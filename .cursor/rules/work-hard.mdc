# Work hard and complete the task

Ultra-think

## Strategy

- First, plan the task. Consider how deep you need to go with the implementation details.
- Then, work hard and complete the task.
- Make sure you cover all the cases. You can use as much tools and thinking time as you need.
- Make sure all the lint warnings are fixed.
- Run yarn build to make sure the project builds.
