## Module 1: Foundations — Why Should I Care?

**Learning objective:** Understand what a public budget is and why it directly affects your life.

**Key concepts:**

- **The budget as a social contract** — it reflects a society's priorities
- Every public service you use (schools, hospitals, roads, police) depends on budget decisions
- The difference between what government *promises* and what it *actually spends*
- Your role: **taxpayer**, **beneficiary**, and **watchdog**

> **Try it on Transparenta.eu:**
> Open the [Budget Explorer](/budget-explorer) and see Romania's total public spending broken down by category. Click on any category to drill deeper.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Public budgets decide how ~43% of Romania's GDP is spent
- You have the right to know how your money is used
- Monitoring budgets is a civic duty — and now it's easier than ever

## Module 2: Where Does the Money Come From? (Revenues)

**Learning objective:** Understand the main sources of public revenue in Romania.

**Key concepts:**

### 1. Taxes paid by individuals

- **Income tax** (impozit pe venit) — 10% flat rate
- **Social contributions:**
  - CAS (pension) — **25%** of gross salary
  - CASS (health) — **10%** of gross salary
  - CAM (employer contribution) — **2.25%**
- Property taxes, vehicle taxes

### 2. Taxes paid by businesses

- Corporate income tax — 16%
- Micro-enterprise tax — 1-3%
- VAT (TVA) — 19% standard rate

> **Legislative Alert:** VAT will increase to **21%** on August 1, 2025 (Law 141/2025).

### 3. European Union funds

- Structural funds, Cohesion Fund, PNRR (Recovery and Resilience Facility)
- Require national co-financing

### 4. Other sources

- Dividends from state-owned enterprises
- Fees, fines, concessions
- Borrowing (public debt)

> **Try it on Transparenta.eu:**
> Switch to [Revenue view](/budget-explorer?accountCategory=vn) in the Budget Explorer to see where public money comes from.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Romania collects only ~34% of GDP in revenue — the lowest in the EU
- Most revenue comes from VAT and social contributions, not income tax
- Low tax collection is why Romania runs a large deficit

## Module 3: Where Does the Money Go? (Expenditures)

**Learning objective:** Understand how public money is allocated and spent.

**Key concepts:**

### 1. By function (what it's for)

- Social protection, Health, Education
- Defense, Public order, Economic affairs
- Infrastructure, Environment, Administration

### 2. By economic nature (what type of spending)

| Code | Type | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| 10 | Personnel | Salaries, bonuses |
| 20 | Goods & services | Office supplies, utilities |
| 71 | Active nefinanciare | Buildings, equipment, infrastructure |
| 50-59 | Transfers | Subsidies, grants |

### 3. By institution (who spends it)

- Ministries and central agencies
- Counties (județe) and local councils
- Public institutions (schools, hospitals)

**Key insight:** Romania spends ~**43.5%** of GDP but collects only ~**34%**, creating a **9.3% deficit**. The problem isn't low spending — it's low revenue collection.

> **Try it on Transparenta.eu:**
> Explore the [Spending Treemap](/budget-explorer) and click on "Education" or "Health" to see detailed breakdowns. Use the [Functional Classification](/classifications/functional/) guide to understand codes.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Social protection is the largest spending category (~35%)
- Capital investments (Code 71) often have low execution rates
- Romania's deficit is among the highest in the EU

## Module 4: The Budget Cycle — A Year in the Life of Public Money

**Learning objective:** Understand when and how budget decisions are made.

**Timeline:**

| Phase | When | What happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Planning** | May-August | Ministry of Finance sets spending ceilings |
| **Drafting** | Sept-Oct 15 | Government prepares budget, submits by **October 15** |
| **Approval** | Oct-December | Parliament debates and votes |
| **Execution** | January-December | Institutions spend according to plan |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly | Execution reports published |
| **Audit** | Following year | Court of Accounts audits spending |

**When to pay attention:** October-December is "budget season" — the best time to engage and provide feedback.

**Key documents:**

- State Budget Law (Legea bugetului de stat)
- Budget execution reports (Rapoarte de execuție)
- Court of Accounts reports (Rapoartele Curții de Conturi)

**Key Takeaways:**

- The budget must be submitted to Parliament by October 15 (legally required)
- Execution reports show what was actually spent vs. planned
- Mid-year rectifications often reveal political priorities

## Module 5: Reading Budget Documents — The Classification System

**Learning objective:** Decode official budget documents.

**The three lenses:**

| Lens | Question | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Organizational** | WHO spends? | Ministry of Education |
| **Functional** | FOR WHAT? | 65.02 = Secondary education |
| **Economic** | WHAT TYPE? | 71 = Capital investments |

**Decoding a budget line:**

```
65.02.04.01 - 71.01.01
│  │  │  │    │  │  │
│  │  │  │    │  │  └─ Sub-article (specific item)
│  │  │  │    │  └──── Article
│  │  │  │    └─────── Title (71 = investments)
│  │  │  └──────────── Paragraph
│  │  └─────────────── Sub-chapter
│  └────────────────── Chapter (02 = local budget)
└───────────────────── Function (65 = Education)
```

> **Try it on Transparenta.eu:**
> Use the [Classification Explorer](/classifications/functional/) to look up any functional code. Try searching for "65.02" to see all education-related categories.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Every budget line has a functional code (what for) and economic code (what type)
- Code 71 (Active nefinanciare) = investments — watch execution rates here
- Understanding codes lets you compare spending across entities

│   ├── Municipalities (103)
│   ├── Towns (217)
│   └── Communes (~2,861)
├── Social Insurance Budget
├── Health Insurance Fund
└── Special funds
```

**Key insight:** Local governments depend heavily on transfers from the central budget — they have limited fiscal autonomy.

> **Try it on Transparenta.eu:**
>
> 1. Open the [Map](/map) to see spending by county
> 2. Use [Entity Analytics](/entity-analytics) to find and compare your city with neighbors
> 3. Click on any entity to see detailed budget breakdowns

**Key Takeaways:**

- Romania has ~3,229 local administrative units (UATs)
- Most local revenue comes from central transfers, not local taxes
- Local budgets are easier to monitor and influence than national ones

## Module 9: Common Issues and Red Flags

**Learning objective:** Recognize potential problems in budget management.

### Red flags to watch for

| Red Flag | What it means | How to spot it |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Low execution rates** | Money allocated but not spent | Execution < 80%, especially for investments |
| **Frequent rectifications** | Poor planning or manipulation | 3+ budget changes per year |
| **Arrears (arierate)** | Unpaid bills accumulating | Growing debt in execution reports |
| **Personnel crowding out investment** | No money for development | Personnel > 60% of budget |
| **Contract splitting** | Avoiding competitive bidding | Multiple contracts just under €27k threshold |
| **Emergency procurement** | Bypassing normal procedures | High % of direct awards |
| **Opaque transfers** | Money moving without clear purpose | Large "other transfers" categories |

### Macro-level red flag

**Romania's ~9.3% deficit** is unsustainable. This means future tax increases or inflation are inevitable — a systemic issue affecting all budgets.

> **Try it on Transparenta.eu:**
> Open [Entity Analytics](/entity-analytics), find a local institution, and check:
>
> 1. What's their execution rate for investments (Code 71)?
> 2. What % of budget goes to personnel (Code 10)?
> 3. How has spending changed year-over-year?

**Key Takeaways:**

- Low investment execution is the classic Romanian budget problem
- Contract splitting and emergency procurement bypass competition
- Always compare execution rates across similar entities

## Module 10: Capstone — Analyze Your Community's Budget

**Final project:** Apply everything you've learned to analyze your local government's budget.

### Step-by-step guide

**Step 1: Find your entity**

- Go to [Entity Analytics](/entity-analytics)
- Search for your city, town, or commune by name
- Click to open the detailed view

**Step 2: Understand the overview**

- Note total spending and revenue
- Check population and per-capita spending
- Compare to similar entities nearby

**Step 3: Identify top spending categories**

- Look at the functional breakdown
- Which 5 categories get the most money?
- Are priorities aligned with community needs?

**Step 4: Calculate execution rates**

- Formula: (Actual Spent ÷ Planned Budget) × 100%
- Compare Code 10 (Personnel) vs Code 71 (Investments)
- Is investment execution below 70%? Investigate why.

**Step 5: Look for red flags**

- Check year-over-year changes

- Compare with neighboring entities

**Step 6: Take action**

- Identify one area worth questioning
- Draft a FOIA request or attend a council meeting
- Share findings with your community

> **Challenge:** If your local council's investment execution rate is below 70%, find out why. Is it poor planning, procurement delays, or lack of capacity?

### Share your findings

Found something interesting? Budget analysis is more powerful when shared. Consider:

- Posting on social media
- Writing to local journalists
- Attending council meetings with specific questions
- Joining civic organizations focused on transparency

**Key Takeaways:**

- Start with your own community — it's most relevant and actionable
- Execution rates reveal the gap between promises and reality
- One informed citizen asking questions can make a difference
