## Design Decisions

### 1. Five-Part Structure

**Decision:** Organize curriculum into 5 thematic parts with 20 modules.

**Rationale:**

- Mirrors the professional development lifecycle: Foundations -> Cycle -> Procurement -> Accountability -> Special Topics
- Allows role-based entry points
- Supports both sequential learning and reference use

**Structure:**

| Part | Focus | Modules |
|------|-------|---------|
| I. Foundations | Role, legal framework, classification | 1-3 |
| II. Budget Cycle | Planning, approval, execution, accounting | 4-8 |
| III. Control & Audit | Internal control, internal audit | 9-10 |
| IV. Procurement | Planning, execution | 11-12 |
| V. Transparency & Accountability | Proactive transparency, external audit, participation | 13-15 |
| VI. Special Topics | EU funds, performance budgeting, crisis, digital, development | 16-20 |

### 2. Role-Based Learning Paths

**Decision:** Provide 6 learning paths based on official role and responsibilities.

**Paths defined:**

| Path | Target Role | Modules | Duration |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| New Official | Just started in public finance | 1, 2, 3 | 4 hours |
| Budget Preparer | Drafts institutional budgets | 4, 5, 11 | 5 hours |
| Execution Manager | Manages spending and payments | 6, 7, 8 | 5 hours |
| Control & Audit | Verifies compliance | 9, 10, 14 | 4 hours |
| EU Funds Manager | Works with European funding | 16, 12 | 4 hours |
| Complete Course | Comprehensive training | All (1-20) | 80-100 hours |

**Rationale:**

- Officials have specific role responsibilities
- Time constraints limit learning capacity
- Targeted paths maximize relevance
- Complete course available for managers and aspiring managers

### 3. Legal Accuracy Priority

**Decision:** All legal references verified and updated with specific article citations.

**Key corrections made:**

| Topic | Common Error | Correct Information |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Budget submission | Various dates | September 1-15 per Art. 34 (Legea 500/2002 as amended) |
| Credit transfers | 20% limit | **10%** at chapter level per Art. 47 |
| Document retention | 10 years | **5 years** per Legea 36/2023 (exception: bilanț 10 years) |
| Draft publication | Calendar days | **30 working days** per Legea 52/2003 |
| Internal control | OUG 119/1999 | **OG 119/1999** (not emergency ordinance) |
| Direct purchase | Old thresholds | **270,120 lei** goods/services, **900,400 lei** works (Jan 2024) |
| PNRR total | 29.1B | **21.4B** (November 2025 revision) |

**Rationale:**

- Legal errors create liability for officials
- Outdated thresholds lead to procurement violations
- Incorrect deadlines cause compliance failures

### 4. Platform Integration for Benchmarking

**Decision:** Position Transparenta.eu as a professional benchmarking tool, not just transparency platform.

**Professional use features:**

| Feature | Professional Use |
|---------|------------------|
| Budget Explorer | Benchmark allocation against sector norms |
| Entity Analytics | Compare execution rates with similar entities |
| Map | Identify regional spending patterns |
| Classifications | Verify correct classification practices |
| Search | Research execution patterns for planning |

**Rationale:**

- Officials need to understand how their institution compares
- External visibility creates accountability pressure
- Benchmarking supports performance improvement

### 5. Liability Framework Emphasis

**Decision:** Include explicit liability guidance throughout curriculum.

**Coverage areas:**

| Liability Type | Module Coverage |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Financial | Module 1, 6, 12 |
| Administrative | Module 1, 9, 10 |
| Criminal | Module 1, 12 |
| Political | Module 1, 15 |

**Rationale:**

- Personal liability is a defining feature of public finance roles
- Officials need clear guidance on risk areas
- Prevention through education more effective than remediation

### 6. Current Threshold Integration

**Decision:** Include current procurement thresholds with explicit update notes.

**Current thresholds (January 2024):**

| Category | Direct Purchase | Simplified | EU Procedure |
|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Goods/Services | <270,120 lei | 270,120-705,819/1,090,812 lei | Above simplified |
| Works | <900,400 lei | 900,400-27,334,460 lei | >27,334,460 lei |
| Social Services | <3,701,850 lei | N/A | >3,701,850 lei |

**Update guidance included:**

- "Verify current values at anap.gov.ro before initiating procurement"
- "Thresholds update periodically with EU regulations"
- "Last updated: December 2025"

**Rationale:**

- Wrong thresholds lead to procurement violations
- Thresholds change with EU regulation updates
- Clear verification guidance prevents errors

### 7. Practical Exercise Design

**Decision:** Include 6 practical exercises aligned with real work tasks.

**Exercises:**

| Exercise | Skill Developed |
|----------|-----------------|
| Budget Preparation | Complete proposal with nota de fundamentare |
| CFPP Simulation | Grant/refuse visa decisions on 10 transactions |
| Procurement-Budget | Develop aligned PAP with current thresholds |
| Crisis Response | Handle 15% revenue shortfall scenario |
| Transparency Audit | Evaluate website against legal requirements |
| Performance Indicators | Develop SMART indicators for program |

**Rationale:**

- Learning must translate to job performance
- Exercises mirror actual work tasks
- Builds confidence before real situations
