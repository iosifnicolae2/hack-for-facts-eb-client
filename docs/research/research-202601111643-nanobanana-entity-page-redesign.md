# Deep Research: Redesigning Entity Budget Page with Nano Banana Pro

## Context

I'm building Transparenta.eu, a public budget transparency platform for Romania. I need to redesign the "Entity Page" which displays comprehensive financial data for a public institution (like a city hall, school, hospital).

## Current Data to Display

The entity page needs to clearly explain:

1. **Executie Bugetara (Budget Execution)**
   - Planned budget vs actual spending
   - Budget utilization rate
   - Quarterly/monthly breakdown
   - Year-over-year comparison

2. **Income/Revenue (Venituri)**
   - Revenue sources breakdown (taxes, transfers, own revenue)
   - Spending by functional classification (education, health, administration)
   - Revenue trends over time
   - Comparison to planned revenue

3. **Expenses (Cheltuieli)**
   - Spending by functional classification (education, health, administration)
   - Spending by economic classification (salaries, goods, capital)
   - Expense trends and comparisons

4. **Inter-institutional Transfers**
   - Money received from other institutions
   - Money transferred to other institutions
   - Transfer flow visualization (Sankey-like)

5. **Entity Metadata**
   - Institution name, type, location
   - Contact information
   - Hierarchy (parent institution)

## Target Audience

- Public sector employees reviewing budgets
- Independent journalists investigating public spending
- Citizens wanting transparency on local government finances
- Researchers analyzing budget patterns

## Design Requirements

- Clean, professional dashboard aesthetic
- Data-dense but not overwhelming
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Mobile-responsive considerations
- Accessible (high contrast, not color-only encoding)
- Should explain complex financial data to non-experts

## Questions for Research

1. **What prompt structure works best for Nano Banana Pro** to generate financial dashboard mockups?
   - How to specify data hierarchies
   - How to request comparison visualizations
   - How to handle multi-section complex layouts

2. **What visual patterns work best** for budget/financial data dashboards?
   - KPI cards vs inline metrics
   - Chart types for budget execution (actual vs planned)
   - How to show inter-institutional money flows

3. **How to structure the prompt context** for Nano Banana Pro:
   - Should I provide actual sample data?
   - How detailed should component descriptions be?
   - How to request consistent design system across multiple mockups?

4. **Iteration strategy**:
   - How do experts refine Nano Banana prompts for UI?
   - What's the recommended workflow: wireframe → high-fidelity?
   - How to request variations of the same layout?

5. **Best practices for government/financial dashboards**:
   - Examples of successful public finance portals
   - Information architecture patterns
   - How to handle large data tables

## Expected Output Format

Please provide:
1. A recommended prompt template specifically for budget/financial dashboards
2. 2-3 example prompts I can use directly with Nano Banana Pro
3. Tips for iteration and refinement
4. Common pitfalls to avoid
5. References to successful public finance dashboard designs
