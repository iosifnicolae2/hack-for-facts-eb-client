Please write a research prompt with reference to our files to investigate how to solve the ssr problems and other related problems specific to each library.

The output should be a multi section markdown file with the following sections:

- Introduction
- Problem Description

The goal of your preliminary research is to identify key problems on our codebase related to tankstack start migration and other libraries that need ssr and start another deep research using chatgpt research and the web.
