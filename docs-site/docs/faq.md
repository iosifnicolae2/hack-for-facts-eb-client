## Who is this for?

Beginners and practitioners who want to explore Romanian public finance quickly and reliably.

## Where does the data come from?

From official budget execution data sources. The app organizes and visualizes them consistently across pages.

## Expenses vs Revenues – what’s the difference?

- Expenses (Cheltuieli): how money is spent
- Revenues (Venituri): how money is collected

## What is Per Capita vs Total?

- Per Capita: normalized by population – fairer across different sizes
- Total: raw amounts – good for scale questions

## Can I share a view?

Yes. Most pages encode state in the URL, and charts encode the entire chart JSON. Copy the link.

## Can I export data?

Use Entity Analytics (CSV export). For charts, copy data or export images if available.

## What if I don’t see a category label?

Labels are lazy‑loaded and cached. They appear as soon as the background fetch completes.
