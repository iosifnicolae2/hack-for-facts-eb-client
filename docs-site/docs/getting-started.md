Welcome! This guide is for first‑time users. You’ll learn what the app does, the basic concepts, and the quickest way to find useful insights.

## What you can do

- Understand a single institution with Entity Details
- Compare geographies with Map
- Rank and shortlist entities with Entity Analytics
- Build and share visual, reproducible charts with Charts

## Key concepts (plain language)

- Entity: a public institution (e.g., a city hall or ministry)
- Year: the reporting year for the data you see
- Expenses vs Revenues: two sides of the budget
- Per Capita vs Total: normalize by population or see raw totals
- Functional/Economic classification: official categories for what money is used for and how it is categorized

## The 10‑minute first tour

1. Search for an entity

- Press ⌘/Ctrl + K or use the search box on the homepage
- Pick an entity (e.g., “Municipiul Sibiu”)

1. Read the Entity Details page

- Switch the year in the header; the whole page updates
- Toggle the trend mode (Absolute vs YoY%)
- Skim the Expenses and Incomes columns and use search to highlight topics (e.g., “Învățământ”)

1. Spot patterns on the Map

- Open Map from the sidebar
- Choose Per Capita to compare UATs fairly
- Click a region to jump to that entity

1. Rank entities in Entity Analytics

- Choose Expenses/Per Capita and the Year
- Sort by the relevant column and export CSV if needed

1. Build a chart

- Go to Charts → Create chart
- Add a series (e.g., line‑items aggregated yearly) and pick filters
- Save and copy the URL to share the exact view
