Follow this hands‑on walkthrough to produce a simple, shareable analysis in 10–15 minutes.

**Who it's for**: Anyone who prefers a guided, practical start.

**Outcomes**: Build and share a two‑series chart comparing cities.

## Goal

“Which cities spend the most per capita on Education in 2024, and how does one city’s spending trend look over time?”

## Steps

1. Find a candidate on the Map

- Open Map
- Select Cheltuieli (Expenses) and Per Capita
- Set Year to 2024
- Add functional prefix “Education (Învățământ)”
- Click a dark region to open that entity’s page

1. Inspect the entity

- On Entity Details, keep Year=2024
- In Overview, read totals and toggle to YoY% for change rate
- In Analytics, switch to Expenses + Bar

1. Build a chart to compare

- Charts → Create chart
- Add a “line‑items aggregated yearly” series
- Choose your entity and Education prefix; save
- Add a second series for another city; save
- Pick Line or Area to see the trend

1. Share the result

- Copy the URL (the full chart is encoded)
- Optional: add annotations to explain spikes

## Tips

- Prefer Per Capita for fair comparisons; use Total for scale
- Keep visible series under control; aggregate when possible
- Use URL search prefixes like `expenseSearch=fn:<prefix>` to jump to topics
