Transparenta.eu helps you explore Romanian public finance data across four main tools:

- Entity Details: a 360° page for a single institution.
- Map: a spatial, filterable heatmap with table and charts.
- Entity Analytics: a filterable, sortable ranking with composition drill-down.
- Charts: a local-first chart builder with shareable deep-links.

Use the workflow to move from “what stands out?” to “why does it happen?” and finally “how do we tell the story?”

**Who it's for**: Everyone who needs a map of the product.

**Outcomes**: Understand when to use each tool and how they connect.
