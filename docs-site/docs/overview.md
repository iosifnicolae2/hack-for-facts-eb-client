### Understanding the Numbers
- Totals vs sub‑totals
  - Totals sum items in your scope; sub‑totals roll up families
- Per Capita vs Total
  - Per Capita divides by population; if 0/missing, value shows 0
- Functional vs Economic
  - Functional = purpose; Economic = nature (e.g., salaries)
- VAT (TVA) and subsidies (Subvenții)
  - Explore them via Economic codes

### Troubleshooting & FAQ
- I cannot find an entity
  - Try fewer words. Check spelling. Try nearby places
- The table is empty
  - Switch to Total. Remove filters. Try another year
- Export is disabled
  - The table has no rows. Broaden filters or change year
- The map looks flat
  - Use Per Capita. Pick a broader code prefix
- Errors on Map
  - “Error loading data”, “Map data not available”, or “No data available for the map” → adjust filters or retry
