title: How to find top spenders (ranking)
---

Goal: Identify the highest per-capita spenders for a topic in a given year.

Steps
1) Open Entity Analytics.
2) Set Cheltuieli (Expenses), Per Capita, and the Year (e.g., 2024).
3) Add a functional prefix (e.g., Education).
4) Sort by Per Capita (desc) and review top results.
5) Export CSV for further work.

Notes
- Use Total for scale questions; Per Capita for fairness.
- Filter by entity type or county for focused cohorts.
