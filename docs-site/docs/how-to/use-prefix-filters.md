title: How to use functional/economic prefix filters
---

Goal: Focus data on a topic like Education or Healthcare using official prefixes.

Steps
1) In Map or Entity Analytics, open the filters panel.
2) Add a Functional Classification prefix (e.g., Education) or Economic Classification prefix as needed.
3) Apply; the heatmap/table updates. In Entity Details, you can search in columns with prefixes via URL (e.g., `expenseSearch=fn:<prefix>`).

Notes
- Prefixes come from official classification datasets and are cached locally after they load.
- Use Per Capita to compare across different population sizes.
