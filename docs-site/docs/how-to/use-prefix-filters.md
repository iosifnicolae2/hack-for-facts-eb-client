title: How to use functional/economic prefix filters
---

Focus data on a topic like Education or Healthcare using official code prefixes. Prefixes match families of codes quickly and precisely.

**Who it’s for**: Anyone narrowing results to a topic family

**Outcomes**: Map/Entities/Charts scoped to your chosen topic, ready to export/share

### Try it now (deep‑links)
1) Open Entities (ranking): https://transparenta.eu/analytics
2) Choose Cheltuieli (Expenses) → Per Capita → Year = 2024
3) Add Functional prefix “65” (Education)
4) Sort Per Capita (DESC) and Export CSV

### Steps
1) Pick your page
   - Map for spatial patterns; Entities for rankings; Charts to visualize
2) Choose scope
   - Cheltuieli/Venituri, Per Capita/Total, Year
3) Add a Functional prefix
   - Enter “65” for Education (broader); refine later (e.g., “65.04”)
4) Optionally add an Economic prefix
   - Enter dotted codes like “10.01” for salaries
5) Apply and review
   - Map colors/tables update; in Charts, save and share

### Expected result
- Results focus on your topic family (e.g., Education) across the chosen scope

### Tips
- Start broad: short prefixes (e.g., “65”) capture entire families.
- Combine Functional + Economic for precision (e.g., Education + Salaries).
- Per Capita is best for fair comparisons; Total for scale questions.
- Prefix searches are index‑friendly and fast.

### Troubleshooting
- No rows after adding a prefix: shorten the prefix or switch to Total.
- Slow results: keep prefixes short; avoid combining many filters at once.
- I can’t find the right code: search classifications first, then paste the prefix.
