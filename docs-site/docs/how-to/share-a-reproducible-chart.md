title: How to share a reproducible chart
---

Goal: Create a chart and share a URL that opens the same view for anyone.

Steps
1) Charts → Create chart.
2) Add a "line-items aggregated yearly" series; choose entities and filters.
3) Optionally add a calculation series or a static dataset.
4) Save; verify the chart renders.
5) Copy the page URL – the `chart` query parameter encodes the full configuration.

Tips
- Keep the number of series manageable; use aggregated-series-calculation to compress insights.
- Add annotations to clarify spikes and data sources.
