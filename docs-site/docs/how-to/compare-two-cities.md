Goal: Compare per-capita Education spending for two municipalities and visualize the trend.

Steps
1) Open Map → set Cheltuieli (Expenses), Per Capita, Year=2024; add functional prefix for Education.
2) Click city A on the map to open its Entity page; note the trend and composition.
3) Charts → Create chart → add first series with city A + Education prefix.
4) Add a second series for city B with the same filters; choose Line chart.
5) Save and copy the chart URL.

Tips
- Keep chart series labels clear (e.g., "Sibiu – Edu – Per Capita").
- Use annotations to explain spikes (e.g., policy changes).
