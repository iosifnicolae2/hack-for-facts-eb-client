### Spending + Filters
- What you see
  - Cheltuieli / Venituri
  - Per Capita / Total (in analytics contexts)
  - Year selector
  - Functional/Economic prefixes
- How to use
  1) Choose Cheltuieli or Venituri
  2) Pick Per Capita for fair comparisons
  3) Set Year
  4) Add a Functional prefix (e.g., 65)
  5) Optionally add an Economic prefix (e.g., 10.01)
- Example
  - Expenses, Per Capita, 2024, Functional 65
- Media
  - ![IMG PLACEHOLDER — Filters](./images/PLACEHOLDER-data-and-analytics-utilities-filters.png "Side, normalization, year, codes")

### Classifications (Functional/Economic)
- What you see
  - Functional = purpose (e.g., Education)
  - Economic = nature (e.g., salaries)
- How to use
  1) Prefer short prefixes for families (“65”)
  2) Use dotted economic prefixes for detail (“10.01”)
  3) Combine both to narrow the topic
- Example
  - 65 + 10.01 for salaries in Education
- Media

  - Charts: multi‑series with “Share Chart”
- How to use
  1) Map: set side, normalization, year, prefixes
  2) Click a region to open its entity

## Understanding the Numbers
- Totals vs sub‑totals
  - Totals sum items in scope; sub‑totals roll up families.
- Per Capita vs Total
  - Per Capita divides by population; if 0/missing, value shows 0.
- Functional vs Economic
  - Functional = purpose; Economic = nature (e.g., salaries).
- Topic families
  - Code prefixes group related items (e.g., Education = 65).

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- No results after filtering
  - Shorten prefixes. Switch to Total. Try another year.
- Export disabled
  - The table has no rows. Broaden filters first.
- Map looks flat
  - Try Per Capita or a broader prefix.
- I can’t find an entity
  - Try fewer words. Check spelling.

  - Press ⌘/Ctrl+K.
- Year selector
