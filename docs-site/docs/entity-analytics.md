- See: ../../docs/user-stories/entity-analytics.md
- Tutorial specs: tests/tutorial/entity-analytics.tutorial.spec.ts and tests/tutorial/entity-analytics.comprehensive.tutorial.spec.ts

How to use it

1. Set Cheltuieli/Venituri and Total/Per Capita.
2. Select year; optionally filter by entity, UAT/county, type, functional/economic prefixes.
3. Table view: sort columns (e.g., Total Amount), adjust rows/page, and review the ranking.
4. Line Items view: open composition for entities matching the filters.

Tips

- Start broad, then narrow with prefixes; prefer Per Capita for fairness.
- Export CSV from the Table view (button visible when data present).
