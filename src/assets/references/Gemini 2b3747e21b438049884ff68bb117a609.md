**Technical Blueprint of the Romanian Public Budget: A Comprehensive Analysis for Data Engineering and Fiscal Transparency**

**Executive Summary: The Digital Archaeology of Public Finance**

The endeavor to construct **transparenta.eu**, a digital platform dedicated to the visualization and analysis of Romanian public spending, represents a challenge that transcends mere software engineering; it is, fundamentally, an exercise in digital archaeology and administrative deconstruction. The Romanian public budget is not a monolithic financial statement but a federated, highly fragmented ecosystem comprised of thousands of distinct legal entities, each generating data streams governed by overlapping, and occasionally conflicting, legislative frameworks. To bridge the chasm between raw administrative data—encapsulated in the cryptic `FXB` files and PDF reports of the *Forexebug* system—and intelligible public information, one must possess a granular understanding of the underlying statutory architecture.
The data engineer tasked with this mission must recognize that the raw data is generated primarily for **accounting compliance and treasury control**, not for public communication or performance analysis. The reporting standards are dictated by **Law no. 500/2002** regarding public finance 1 and **Law no. 273/2006** regarding local public finance 2, which establish a rigid "Cash Basis" execution logic. This stands in contrast to the "Accrual Basis" (ESA 2010) standards used for European reporting, creating a dissonance that the platform’s engineering logic must resolve through algorithmic adjustments.3
This report serves as the foundational technical dossier for the platform's backend logic. It is structured to guide the transformation of administrative artifacts into a coherent data warehouse. We will dissect the hierarchical flow of credit authorizers (*ordonatori de credite*), providing the exact logic required to trace a leu from the Ministry of Finance down to a rural school. We will establish the "Elimination Matrix" necessary to consolidate budgets without the statistical error of double-counting, identifying the specific transfer codes that must be neutralized. Finally, we will provide an exhaustive educational dictionary, translating the esoteric alphanumeric codes of the budget classification into the economic realities they represent—from personnel costs to complex European investment vehicles.

**Pillar 1: The Architecture of the Romanian Public Budget**

The structural integrity of any fiscal data model relies on a correct mapping of the administrative hierarchy. In Romania, this hierarchy is defined by a dichotomy between the centralization of fiscal policy (at the Ministry of Finance) and the decentralization of budget execution (at the level of individual institutions). Understanding this architecture is prerequisite to parsing any dataset, as the "Sector" and "Source" codes found in the header of every FXB file are derived directly from this legal structure.

**1.1 Hierarchy and Flow: The Federated Budget System**

The concept of the "General Consolidated Budget" (*Bugetul General Consolidat* - BGC) is a statistical construct rather than a single operational bank account. It is the aggregate result of fusing several distinct, autonomous budgetary systems. When a user queries the platform for "Total Education Spending," the query must traverse multiple disjointed datasets, aggregating them while simultaneously filtering out internal transactions.

**The Component Budgets and Their Interdependencies**

According to the definitions in **Law 500/2002** 1 and **Law 273/2006** 2, the public financial system is composed of several primary aggregates. Each of these components has distinct reporting channels and specific "Sector" codes in the *Forexebug* system.
1. **The State Budget (*Bugetul de Stat* - Sector 01):**
    ◦ **Role:** This is the central nervous system of national finance, managed directly by the Ministry of Finance (MF). It encompasses the budgets of all supreme state powers (Parliament, Presidency), Ministries (Education, Health, Transport, Defense), and central agencies.
    ◦ **Data Characteristic:** A defining feature of Sector 01 data is the high volume of "Transfer" expenditures (specifically Title 51 and Title 56). The State Budget often acts as a pass-through entity, collecting taxes and redistributing them to Local Budgets (Sector 02) or Social Security (Sector 03).
    ◦ **Engineering Implication:** When analyzing Sector 01, the analyst must distinguish between *operational spending* (e.g., buying tanks for the Ministry of Defense) and *distributive spending* (e.g., sending money to a County Council for roads). Failure to distinguish these leads to a gross misrepresentation of central government consumption.
2. **Local Budgets (*Bugetele Locale* - Sector 02):**
    ◦ **Role:** Governed by **Law 273/2006** 5, this sector aggregates the financial activity of over 3,200 Administrative-Territorial Units (UATs)—Communes, Towns, Municipalities, and Counties (*Județe*). This sector is the primary engine for local infrastructure development and utility management.
    ◦ **Complexity:** Each UAT functions as an autonomous financial island. They rely heavily on "Decoy" revenues—technically termed "Balanced Amounts from VAT" (*Sume defalcate din TVA*) or quotas from Income Tax—which are transfers from the State Budget.
    ◦ **Data Flow:** The Local Budget is further stratified. It includes the "Own Budget" of the UAT (Source A) and the budgets of subordinate institutions financed partly or fully by own revenues (Source E, F, G).
3. **Social Security Budgets (*BASS* & *FNUASS*):**
    ◦ **State Social Security Budget (BASS - Sector 03):** This budget is dedicated primarily to the public pension system. It is managed centrally by the National House of Public Pensions (CNPP) but is reported separately from the State Budget.
    ◦ **National Health Insurance Fund (FNUASS - Sector 05):** Managed by the National Health Insurance House (CNAS). This is the financial reservoir for the public health system.
    ◦ **Visualization Risk:** A common error in public analysis is to assume the Ministry of Health's budget represents the total health expenditure. In reality, the Ministry (Sector 01) funds public health programs, capital investments, and emergency units (UPU), while the FNUASS (Sector 05) funds the actual medical services, pharmacy compensations, and hospital running costs. The data engineering logic must combine these two sectors to provide a holistic view of Health spending.
4. **Institutions Financed by Own Revenues (*Venituri Proprii*):**
    ◦ **Mechanism:** Many public institutions—such as public hospitals, universities, and cultural institutions (theaters, museums)—are authorized to generate and retain their own income (e.g., tuition fees, ticket sales, medical service fees).
    ◦ **Reporting:** These entities report execution separately, often appearing as distinct files with specific "Source" codes (e.g., Source E, F, G) attached to either Sector 01 or Sector 02 parents.

**1.2 Key Actors: The "Ordonatori de Credite" Hierarchy**

The execution of the Romanian budget follows a strict, militaristic chain of command known as the hierarchy of Credit Authorizers (*Ordonatori de Credite*). In the FXB files, identifying the rank of the reporting entity is crucial for determining how to aggregate the data and where the legal liability for the expenditure resides.

**The Classification of Authorizers**

**Law 500/2002** (Art. 20-22) and **Law 273/2006** establish three tiers of financial responsibility 6:
1. **Principal Credit Authorizer (*Ordonator Principal* - OPC):**
    ◦ **Who:** At the central level, these are Ministers and heads of autonomous central authorities. At the local level, these are the Mayors of Communes, Towns, and Municipalities, and the Presidents of County Councils.
    ◦ **Role:** The OPC is the only actor who interacts directly with the Budget Law (or Local Council Decision). They receive the total "envelope" of funds.
    ◦ **Authority:** They have the power to distribute credits to subordinate institutions (Secondary and Tertiary authorizers). They also possess the limited authority to transfer credits between budget chapters (typically up to 20% of a chapter's provision) throughout the year to adjust for operational needs.6
    ◦ **Data Trace:** The OPC's report often contains a "Consolidated" view, but for granular transparency, one must look at the reports of the subordinates.
2. **Secondary Credit Authorizer (*Ordonator Secundar* - OSC):**
    ◦ **Who:** Heads of intermediate institutions that oversee other entities. For example, a County School Inspectorate (*Inspectoratul Școlar Județean*) or a regional directory of a Ministry.
    ◦ **Role:** They act as a conduit. They receive funds from the OPC and distribute them to the Tertiary authorizers (the schools). They monitor the execution of the subordinates.
3. **Tertiary Credit Authorizer (*Ordonator Terțiar* - OTC):**
    ◦ **Who:** The operational managers: School Principals, Hospital Managers, Directors of Museums, heads of local police units.
    ◦ **Role:** These are the actors who actually *spend* the money. They sign the commercial contracts, validate the invoices (Liquidation), and authorize the payments (Payment).
    ◦ **Data Trace:** In the execution files (FXB), the specific "Payment" (*Plata Efectuată*) usually originates here.
    ◦ **Legal Mandate:** According to **Law 500/2002**, Tertiary authorizers use the budget credits distributed to them solely for the realization of the tasks of the institutions they lead.7
The Data Flow Scenario: A School Renovation
To illustrate the data engineering challenge, consider the flow of a renovation project:
1. **Parliament** approves the budget for the Ministry of Development (Sector 01, OPC).
2. **Ministry** transfers funds via Title 51 to a Local Council (Sector 02, OPC). *Transaction 1: Transfer Expense.*
3. **Mayor** allocates funds to the specific School (Tertiary Authorizer).
4. **School** signs a contract with a private construction firm.
5. **School** makes the payment via Title 71 (Capital Assets). *Transaction 2: Final Expenditure.*
*Engineering Insight:* If the platform ingests data from all three levels without filtering, this single renovation project is counted multiple times: once as an expense at the Ministry, once at the Mayor's level (if consolidated incorrectly), and once at the School. The "Consolidation" logic (Pillar 2) must identify Transactions 1 and 2, eliminate the transfer components, and isolate the School's payment as the "Final Consumption."

**1.3 Budget Sectors: Decoding the Metadata**

The administrative files use a "Sector Code" to partition the database. This is the primary key for segmentation in the *Forexebug* system and determines the parsing rules.9**Sector CodeDescriptionKey Characteristics for Data Engineering01State Budget** (*Bugetul de Stat*)Contains Ministries. High volume of transfers (Title 51/56/58) to other sectors.**02Local Budget** (*Bugetul Local*)Contains UATs (Communes, Cities, Counties). Primary source of infrastructure spending (roads, utilities).**03Social Security** (*Asigurări Sociale de Stat*)Pensions (BASS). Managed by CNPP. Funding flows primarily to beneficiaries.**04Unemployment** (*Șomaj*)Unemployment benefits. Managed by ANOFM.**05Health Fund** (*FNUASS*)Health insurance funds. Managed by CNAS. Contains payments to hospitals and pharmacies.**06State Treasury**Operational costs of the Treasury itself.**08External Non-Reimbursable Funds**Specific external grants (often pre-accession or non-EU donors) not routed through 01.**10Own Revenues** (*Venituri Proprii*)Often consolidated into 01 or 02 depending on subordination, but sometimes reported distinctly.
*Technical Note:* In *Forexebug* XML files (FXB-EXB-901), the tag `<P_SECB>` contains this value. A critical error in processing is merging Sector 02 (Local) with Sector 01 (State) without strictly applying the elimination matrix.10

**1.4 The Lifecycle of Money: ALOP (Angajare, Lichidare, Ordonanțare, Plată)**

For **transparenta.eu**, the distinction between "Budgeted" and "Spent" is crucial. It represents the difference between political intent and economic reality. The Romanian system tracks three distinct phases, governed by the ALOP mechanism (Commitment, Liquidation, Ordering, Payment).13
1. **Budget Estimates (*Prevederi Bugetare*):**
    ◦ **Definition:** The maximum limit of spending approved by Parliament (for State Budget) or the Local Council (for Local Budgets).
    ◦ **Types:**
        ▪ *Initial:* The figure approved at the start of the year (usually in December/January).
        ▪ *Definitive:* The figure adjusted after "Budget Rectifications" (*rectificări bugetare*), which occur periodically (usually mid-year and year-end) to reallocate resources based on execution rates.
    ◦ *Usage:* These figures are useful for analyzing "Execution Rates" (Efficiency). A low execution rate implies administrative incapacity.
2. **Commitments (*Angajamente*):**
    ◦ **Budgetary Commitment (*Angajament Bugetar*):** The administrative reservation of funds. It acts as a "hold" on the bank account. "I plan to spend this".16
    ◦ **Legal Commitment (*Angajament Legal*):** The moment of signing a contract or placing an order. This creates the legal liability for the state. "I have a legal obligation to pay this".1
    ◦ *Crucial for Transparency:* A large gap between "Legal Commitments" and "Payments" is the primary indicator of **Arrears** (*Arierate*). It means the state has signed contracts but is not paying the bills, potentially leading to insolvency or penalties.
3. **Actual Payments (*Plăți Efectuate*):**
    ◦ **Definition:** The moment cash actually leaves the Treasury account. This is the "Cash Basis" execution.1
    ◦ **Visualization Focus:** **This is the gold standard for your platform.** It represents the actual injection of resources into the economy.
    ◦ **Warning - Advances:** Payments include "advances" (*avansuri*) given to contractors (especially in EU projects) before work is completed. While this is a cash outflow, it does not always correspond to "work done" in the engineering sense.

**1.5 Legal Basis: The Statutory Framework**

To ensure the platform's methodology is defensible, it must reference the specific articles of the law that dictate these structures.
• **Law 500/2002 (Public Finance):**
    ◦ *Art. 2:* Defines the budget year and principles of universality.1
    ◦ *Art. 4:* Establishes the hierarchy of credit authorizers (Principal, Secondary, Tertiary).6
    ◦ *Art. 14:* Prohibits spending without a legal basis and budget provision.6
    ◦ *Art. 52:* Dictates the mandatory ALOP flow phases (Commitment -> Liquidation -> Ordering -> Payment).
• **Law 273/2006 (Local Public Finance):**
    ◦ *Art. 1:* Defines the scope of local budgets.2
    ◦ *Art. 28-29:* Rules for own revenues and capital valorization (selling assets).5
    ◦ *Art. 72:* Rules for temporary loans from the Treasury to cover cash flow gaps.17

**Pillar 2: Algorithmic Consolidation (The Engineering Logic)**

The "General Consolidated Budget" (*Bugetul General Consolidat* - BGC) is not a summation; it is a set-theoretic union where intersection points (transfers) must be subtracted. If a data engineer simply sums all FXB files from all sectors, they will double-count approximately 20-30% of the total public expenditure, creating a fictitious economy.

**2.1 Definition and the Necessity of Elimination**

**Consolidation** is legally defined in **Law 273/2006** as "the operation of eliminating transfers of sums between two component budgets... to avoid double highlighting".2
• The Mechanics of Double Counting:
Consider the flow of salary payments for university professors:
    1. The Ministry of Education transfers 100M RON to a University. The Ministry records this as an **Expense** under **Title 51** (Transfers).
    2. The University receives 100M RON. It records this as **Revenue** (Subsidies).
    3. The University pays 100M RON to professors. It records this as an **Expense** under **Title 10** (Salaries).
    ◦ *Raw Sum:* 200M RON (100M Ministry Expense + 100M University Expense).
    ◦ *Reality:* 100M RON (The actual salaries paid).
    ◦ *Engineering Goal:* The platform must identify the 100M at Title 51 and suppress it, or suppress the revenue at the University and view the Ministry as the source. Standard practice is to **eliminate the Transfer Expense (Title 51) and the Transfer Revenue (Source 43/48)** to leave only the final expenditure (Title 10) at the destination.19

**2.2 The Elimination Matrix**

To construct the "Consolidated" view in your database, you must implement a "Netting Algorithm." This algorithm looks for corresponding pairs of **Expenditure Codes (Source)** and **Revenue Codes (Destination)**. The following matrix details the specific codes that must be targeted for elimination.

**Scenario 1: Local Level Consolidation (UAT Internal)**

A Municipality (Mayor's budget) transfers funds to a subordinate High School or Cultural House.
• **Source (Mayor - Sector 02, Source A):** Expenditures are recorded under **Title 51** ("Transferuri între unități ale administrației publice").
    ◦ *Specific Code:* **51.01.01** (Transferuri către instituții publice).20
• **Destination (School - Sector 02, Source E):** Revenues are recorded under **Subchapter 43.02** ("Subvenții de la alte administrații") or **43.10** (Subvenții din bugetele locale).
    ◦ *Specific Code:* **43.02.01** (Subvenții primite de la bugetele locale).
• Algorithm Rule:
$$Consolidated\_Revenue = \sum Revenues - \sum Code\_43.02.xx$$$$Consolidated\_Expenditure = \sum Expenditures - \sum Code\_51.01.xx$$

**Scenario 2: Central Level (Ministry to Agency/Local)**

The State Budget transfers funds to Local Budgets (e.g., for heating aid, salary support, or road maintenance).
• **Source (State Budget - Sector 01):**
    ◦ **Title 51.01** (Current Transfers).21
    ◦ **Title 51.02** (Capital Transfers/Investments) - Used for infrastructure development transfers.22
• **Destination (Local Budget - Sector 02):**
    ◦ **Code 42.02** (Subvenții de la bugetul de stat).
    ◦ **Code 43.02** (Subvenții de la alte administrații - if indirect).
• Matching Logic:
When aggregating Sector 01 + Sector 02:
    ◦ *Exclude* Sector 01 expenses where Title = 51.
    ◦ *Exclude* Sector 02 revenues where Subchapter = 42.02 or 43.02.

**Scenario 3: Health System (The Triangle of Confusion)**

The Ministry of Health (MS), the National Health Insurance House (CNAS), and Hospitals create a complex flow.
• **Flow:** Ministry of Finance -> Ministry of Health/CNAS -> Hospitals.
• **Elimination Strategy:**
    1. Eliminate Transfer from State Budget to BASS/FNUASS (Title 51.01.07 or 51.01.11 at State level; Income at BASS/FNUASS).
    2. Eliminate Transfer from CNAS to Hospital (Title 51 at CNAS, Income at Hospital).
    ◦ *Result:* The consolidated view should sum the Title 10 (Salaries) and Title 20 (Medicines/Goods) at the *Hospital* level, plus the Title 51 (Investments) retained by the Ministry for central procurement.

**2.3 Edge Cases and Special Logic**

**A. Sume în curs de decontare (Settlements in Progress)**

• *The Problem:* At the end of the month or year, cash may have left Account A but not yet arrived in Account B. This creates a temporary imbalance in the "Zero Sum" game of double-entry bookkeeping.
• *Codes:* **Title 85** (Plăți efectuate în anii precedenți și recuperate) and accounts like **512.05** (Sume în curs de decontare).24
• *Handling:* In a yearly report, these usually net out. However, in monthly visualizations, these should be categorized as "Transit Funds" or "Settlement Operations" rather than operational spending to avoid artificial spikes in the dashboard. Specifically, **Title 85** represents a *recovery* of funds (a negative expense) and should be visualized as such or netted against current year spending.

**B. Excedent/Deficit (Surplus/Deficit) Coverage**

• *Concept:* A budget deficit is financed by debt or previous surplus. The accounting system must balance, so "Deficit" is sometimes recorded as a line item to make the columns match.
• *Codes:* **Title 90 (92/93)** represents the accounting result (Surplus/Deficit).24
• *Engineering Rule:* Do NOT sum Title 90 into "Total Expenditure." It is a balancing item. If Title 90 is positive (Deficit coverage), it explains *how* money was found, not *where* it was spent.
• *Previous Years' Surplus:* Code **98.02** (Excedentul anului precedent) is often used as a revenue source in the current year.17 Treat this as "Financing," not "New Revenue."

**C. EU Funds (The FEN Complexity)**

EU funds appear in multiple titles depending on the programming period. They require special "Non-Reimbursable" consolidation logic because the cash flow involves reimbursement mechanisms.
• **Title 56:** Post-Accession FEN (old, 2007-2013).
• **Title 58:** FEN 2014-2020 Framework.28
• **Title 60/61:** New Framework (2021-2027) and Recovery Fund (PNRR).
• **The Logic:**
    ◦ These titles act like "Investment" titles but contain a mix of capital (assets) and current (consultancy) costs.
    ◦ *Transfers:* Often, the State Budget pays the "Cofinancing" part to the Local Budget. This appears as a transfer *within* Title 58 (e.g., **58.01.03**).
    ◦ *Rule:* You must verify if the sub-article is a "Transfer" (e.g., to an NGO or UAT). If so, eliminate it if you also have the beneficiary's data. If you lack beneficiary data (e.g., private NGO), keep it as final expenditure.

**D. The ESA 2010 vs. Cash Basis Divergence**

One of the most significant sources of confusion for users comparing platform data with Eurostat reports is the methodological difference between **Cash** (Execution) and **Accrual** (ESA 2010).3
• **Cash Basis (Execution Data):** Records the transaction when the payment is made. This is what *Forexebug* provides.
• **Accrual Basis (ESA 2010):** Records the transaction when the economic value is created (e.g., when the road is built), regardless of when the invoice is paid.
• **Implication:** Your platform will show the *Cash Deficit*. The "European Deficit" (ESA 2010) will differ because it includes "Payable Accounts" (invoices received but not paid - arrears) and excludes "Receivable Accounts" (taxes owed but not collected). You cannot calculate the exact ESA 2010 deficit solely from FXB execution files, but you can approximate it by adjusting for "Arrears" (Title 85 recoveries and committed-but-unpaid sums).

**Pillar 3: Classification Dictionary (The Educational Module)**

For **transparenta.eu** to be educational, the cryptic codes of the Ministry of Finance must be translated into user-centric categories. The Romanian budget classification system is dual: **Functional** (Who/Purpose) and **Economic** (What/Nature).

**3.1 Functional Classification (The "Who/Purpose")**

This classification answers the question: "For what function of society is money spent?" It serves as the primary navigation tree for citizens.2
**Hierarchy:**
• **Capitol (XX.02):** The broad domain (e.g., Education).
• **Subcapitol:** Specific level (e.g., Secondary Education).
• **Paragraf:** Granular detail (e.g., High Schools).

**The Citizen's Map: Essential Capitols**
**Code (Capitol)Friendly NameDefinition for Educational Module51.02Administrație Publică**"Bureaucracy & Governance." Covers salaries of mayors, city hall bills, functioning of parliament, and local councils. High Title 10 (Salaries) and Title 20 (Goods).**54.02Alte Servicii Publice**Emergency funds, diverse public services (e.g., Evidența Populației - ID cards).**55.02Datorie Publică**"Interest Payments." The cost of borrowing money. This chapter contains almost exclusively Title 30 expenditures.**61.02Ordine Publică**Police, Gendarmerie, Firefighters (ISU). Does NOT include Defense (which is 60.02).**65.02Educație**Schools, kindergartens, universities. *Note:* Often covers salaries and goods; investments (building new schools) might sometimes appear in separate development chapters (70.02) if managed by local development agencies.**66.02Sănătate**Hospitals, public health clinics. *Note:* Massive difference between Ministry budget and total Health Fund (FNUASS).**67.02Cultură & Religie**Museums, theaters, parks, green spaces, and subsidies for churches (religious cults).**68.02Asistență Socială**Pensions, child allowances, heating aid, unemployment benefits. The largest chapter in terms of volume (due to pensions).**70.02Locuințe & Utilități**"Public Works." Water networks, street lighting, sewage, social housing. Heavily used by Local Administration for Title 71 (Investments).**74.02Protecția Mediului**Garbage collection (Salubritate), pollution control, waste management.**84.02Transporturi**Roads, highways, railways, public transit subsidies (STB/Metrorex). Critical for infrastructure analysis.

**3.2 Economic Classification (The "What")**

This classification answers "What did we buy?" (Salaries, bricks, paper, electricity). It applies *across* all functional chapters.28

**The "Real Economy" Buckets**

**1. The Payroll Bucket (Cheltuieli de Personal)**
• **Title:** **10**
• *Components:*
    ◦ **10.01:** Money in hand (Salaries, Bonuses). Subcodes like `10.01.01` (Basic Salary), `10.01.05` (Bonuses for conditions), `10.01.12` (Indemnities for external collaborators).
    ◦ **10.02:** Benefits in kind. Includes Meal vouchers (*Tichete de masă* - `10.02.01`), Holiday vouchers (*Vouchere de vacanță* - `10.02.06`), and Uniforms (`10.02.03`).
    ◦ **10.03:** Contributions. Specifically the "Work Insurance Contribution" (CAM - `10.03.07`).
• *Analytical Insight:* A high ratio of Title 10 in "Education" (65.02) is normal; a high ratio in "Transport" (84.02) suggests inefficiency (paying staff instead of building roads).
**2. The Operations Bucket (Bunuri și Servicii)**
• **Title:** **20**
• *Components:*
    ◦ **20.01:** Utilities (Gas, Light, Water), Office supplies.
    ◦ **20.02:** Repairs (Pothole filling, painting walls).
    ◦ **20.05:** Inventory objects (Computers, desks, furniture).
    ◦ **20.30.30:** "Other expenditures" (*Alte cheltuieli cu bunuri și servicii*). This code acts as a catch-all black box. In smaller communes (UATs), high usage of `20.30.30` often masks discretionary spending on events, protocol, or consultancy.
**3. The Welfare Bucket (Asistență Socială)**
• **Title:** **57**
• *Components:* Pensions, Child Allowances, Indemnities. Money transferred directly to households. Unlike Title 10 (Salaries), this is a transfer payment with no direct labor exchange.
**4. The Development Bucket (Investiții)**
• **Title:** **70/71** (Cheltuieli de Capital / Active Nefinanciare).
    ◦ *Real Assets:* Buildings, heavy machinery, land.
    ◦ *Code 71.01.01:* Constructions.
    ◦ *Code 71.01.30:* Other fixed assets. *Warning:* This code often hides "Feasibility Studies" (*Studii de Fezabilitate*)—paperwork for projects that may never be built.
• **Title:** **58/60** (EU Funds).
    ◦ *Mixed:* These titles contain both soft costs (consultancy, training) and hard assets. Classifying 100% of EU funds as "Investment" is a common simplification, but technically inaccurate.
• *Mapping Rule:* For a "Development" metric, sum Title 71 + Title 58 + Title 60.
**5. The Debt Bucket (Datorii)**
• **Title:** **30** (Dobânzi - Interest). The cost of borrowing (servicing the debt). This is an expense.
• **Title:** **81** (Rambursări - Principal Repayments). Paying back the principal of the loan.
• *Important:* Title 81 is often treated as a "Financial Operation" ("below the line") in deficit calculations because it reduces liability rather than consuming resources. However, it is a massive cash outflow for the Treasury.

**3.3 Mapping Exercise: Consolidated Indicators vs. Execution Codes**

When comparing your platform's data to Eurostat or Ministry Macro Reports, use this translation table to align your definitions with macroeconomic standards.3**Consolidated Indicator (Macro)Constituent Execution Codes (FXB)Notes for EngineeringTotal Personnel CostsTitle 10** (All Sectors)Simple summation across all functional chapters.**Total Goods & ServicesTitle 20** (All Sectors)Simple summation. Watch for `20.30.30` outliers.**Total Social TransfersTitle 57** + **Title 51** (Social parts only)Requires granular filtering. E.g., include `51.01.04` (Handicap transfers) but exclude `51.01.01` (Institutional transfers).**Total Investment (Capex)Title 71** + **Title 72** + (~50-70% of **Title 58/60**)EU funds are hybrid. A precise split requires analyzing the *Project Fiche* (unavailable in standard FXB). A conservative estimate is safer.**Interest PaymentsTitle 30**Strictly Title 30. Exclude Title 81 (Principal Repayment).**SubsidiesTitle 40**Subsidies for heat (RADET), transport (CFR/Metro), and agriculture.**Budget Deficit (Cash)(Total Rev - Total Exp)Do not include Title 90/92/93 in Expenses.** Exclude Title 81 from Expenses for deficit calc (it's financing). Include Title 85 as a correction to expenses.

**4. Technical Implementation Notes (Data Engineering Module)**

**4.1 Parsing the Forexebug Files**

The `FXB-EXB-901` file (XML format) is the primary artifact for execution data.10
• **Structure:**
    ◦ `<G_2>`: Sector Code (01, 02).
    ◦ `<G_6>`: Source of Funding (A=Integral State/Local, E=Own Revenue).
    ◦ `Cod_Indicator`: A string that concatenates Chapter, Subchapter, Title, Article, and Alineat (e.g., `65.02.04.02.10.01.01`).
• **Parsing Logic:** You must implement a regex parser that splits the `Cod_Indicator`. The break point is dynamic. The functional code ends at the Paragraf level, and the economic code begins at the Title level.
    ◦ *Example:* `65.02.04.02` (Secondary Education) + `10.01.01` (Basic Salaries).

**4.2 Data Cleaning and "Ghost" Money**

• **Zero Values:** FXB files often contain rows for every possible budget code, even if the value is 0. Filter `Plati_Efectuate!= 0` to reduce database size by ~80%.
• **Title 85 & 90:** As mentioned in Edge Cases, strictly segregate these titles. They are accounting corrections and balancing items, not operational spending. Visualizing Title 90 as "Spending" is a critical error that will skew all deficit charts.
By rigorously implementing this architecture, **transparenta.eu** will transcend the limitations of a simple data visualizer. It will function as a coherent analytical engine, capable of distinguishing between the *movement* of money (transfers) and the actual *utilization* of money (goods, salaries, investments), finally offering the Romanian public a clear window into the workings of their state.
