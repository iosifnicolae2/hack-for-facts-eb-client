# Romanian Public Finance Architecture: A Technical Guide for Transparenta.eu

**The Romanian budget system operates on a sophisticated three-tier structure with strict consolidation rules to prevent double-counting, governed by Laws 500/2002 and 273/2006, using the FOREXEBUG electronic reporting system to track actual payments (Plăți Efectuate) across 14,056 public entities.** This system eliminates inter-governmental transfers during consolidation—specifically Title 51 expenditures matched with Chapter 42-43 revenues—to reveal true public financial effort. The classification framework aligns with EU standards (ESA2010, COFOG), dividing spending both functionally (education, health, transport) and economically (salaries, goods, investments), enabling transparent visualization of how Romanian taxpayer money flows from national ministries down to local schools and hospitals.

Understanding this architecture is critical for transparenta.eu because simple summation of budget rows creates massive double-counting errors—the same money appears multiple times as it transfers from state budget to local governments to individual institutions. The consolidation methodology eliminates these internal flows, revealing that while unconsolidated totals might show 730 million lei, the actual public effort is only 615 million lei after removing the 115 million in internal transfers. This 19-article deep-dive provides the exact algorithms, legal foundations, and classification codes needed to build accurate visualizations.

## Pillar 1: The Architecture of the Romanian Public Budget

### The fundamental structure mirrors a cascading waterfall of authority and money

Romania's budget system comprises multiple interdependent components defined in **Law 500/2002, Article 1(2)**. At the apex sits the **Bugetul de Stat** (State Budget), containing central government revenues and expenditures managed by ministries and national agencies. Parallel to this operates the **Bugetul Asigurărilor Sociale de Stat** (BASS - Social Security Budget), handling pensions and social insurance independently. The **Bugetele Locale** (Local Budgets), governed separately by **Law 273/2006**, encompass all territorial administrative units—communes, cities, municipalities, sectors of Bucharest, and counties—each maintaining their own budget approved by elected local councils.

The system also includes **Special Funds** for designated purposes, the **Treasury Budget** managing cash flow, and budgets for **autonomous public institutions** (universities, research centers) plus institutions funded wholly or partially from public budgets (hospitals, schools) and those financed from own revenues (certain cultural institutions). External financing appears in two additional categories: the **External Credit Funds Budget** and the **Non-Reimbursable External Funds Budget** covering EU grants and foreign assistance.

These components don't operate independently—they interconnect through transfers and subsidies. When the Ministry of Education transfers money to a county education department, which then sends funds to individual schools, that same money appears three times in raw data. **Law 500/2002, Article 2(18)** defines consolidation as "the operation of eliminating transfers between two component budgets of the consolidated general budget, to avoid double recording." This principle underlies every consolidation algorithm described in Pillar 2.

### Three tiers of credit authorizers control how money actually moves

The Romanian system distributes budget authority through a three-level hierarchy defined in **Law 273/2006, Article 21** for local budgets and **Law 500/2002, Article 20** for central budgets. At the top tier, **Ordonatori Principali de Credite** (Principal Credit Authorizers) include ministers heading central government ministries, mayors of municipalities and communes, county presidents, and directors of autonomous institutions. These individuals bear ultimate responsibility for their entire budget domain—they approve overall budgets, allocate credits to subordinate entities, analyze execution, and ensure legal compliance.

The middle tier consists of **Ordonatori Secundari de Credite** (Secondary Credit Authorizers), typically department directors within ministries or county-level education/health directors under local government. **Article 22(2)** specifies they "distribute budget credits approved for their own budget and for budgets of institutions whose directors are tertiary credit authorizers, and approve expenditures from their own budgets." They serve as intermediate consolidation points, aggregating reports from multiple tertiary authorizers.

At the operational level, **Ordonatori Terțiari de Credite** (Tertiary Credit Authorizers) run individual schools, hospitals, cultural centers, and other direct service delivery units. **Article 22(3)** restricts them to using allocated credits "only for fulfilling the tasks of the units they lead, according to approved budget provisions." They execute actual payments but cannot reallocate funds beyond their specific mandate.

Consider a concrete example of this hierarchy in action. A school director (tertiary) prepares monthly execution reports showing salaries paid to teachers (Title 10.01), utilities consumed (Title 20.01.03), and any small repairs (Title 20.02). These reports flow upward—potentially through a county education department (secondary) that consolidates data from 50 schools—and eventually reach the mayor (principal). The mayor's budget shows a Title 51.01.01 transfer to that school, matching the school's Chapter 43.10.09 receipt. During consolidation, both entries cancel out. The mayor then submits consolidated municipal data to the County Finance Directorate (Direcția Generală a Finanțelor Publice Județene), which aggregates all municipalities in the county before sending to the Ministry of Finance for national consolidation.

### Budget sectors separate money by institutional type and funding source

The Romanian classification system employs a "Sector" code to categorize institutions by their position in the administrative hierarchy and primary funding source. This coding appears in all execution files and determines which consolidation rules apply. **Sector 01** designates the **State Budget (central administration)**, encompassing Parliament, the Presidency, all ministries, and national agencies like the National Road Company or cultural institutions funded directly from central government. When you see Sector 01 in data, you're viewing central government operations.

**Sector 02** marks **Local Budgets (local administration)**—the 3,181 communes, 320 cities and municipalities, 41 counties, and 6 Bucharest sectors that comprise Romania's territorial administrative units. Each maintains its own budget approved by locally elected councils, funding local services from local taxes plus transfers from central government. Schools, local hospitals, municipal utilities, and cultural centers funded by mayors or county presidents carry Sector 02 classification.

**Sector 03** identifies the **Social Security Budget (Bugetul Asigurărilor Sociale de Stat)**, the massive fund paying retirement pensions to Romania's pensioners. This operates independently with dedicated contribution revenue streams and its own budget law. **Sector 04** covers the **Unemployment Insurance Budget**, managing unemployment benefits and active labor market programs. **Sector 05** represents the **National Health Insurance Fund (FNUASS - Fondul Național Unic de Asigurări Sociale de Sănătate)**, which contracts with hospitals and clinics to provide universal health coverage.

These sector codes are essential for consolidation algorithms because transfers between sectors follow different patterns than transfers within sectors. A Sector 01 ministry transferring to a Sector 02 municipality requires different elimination codes than a Sector 02 mayor transferring to a subordinate Sector 02 institution.

### The budget lifecycle moves through three distinct phases from approval to payment

Romanian budget execution follows a carefully defined progression established in **Law 500/2002, Article 52(1)**: "In the budget execution process, budget expenditures go through the following phases: commitment, liquidation, authorization, payment." Understanding these phases is crucial because execution reports may show different numbers depending on which phase you're measuring.

**Prevederi Bugetare** (Budget Allocations) represent the starting point—the maximum spending limits approved by Parliament for state budget entities or by local councils for municipalities. Defined in **Law 500/2002, Article 2(16)** as "credit bugetar," these are the ceilings established in the budget law. If a school receives 10 million lei in approved budget allocations for the year, it cannot legally commit or spend beyond this amount. This represents authorized capacity, not actual spending.

**Angajamente** (Commitments) occur when that capacity converts to specific obligations. **Article 2(2)** defines "angajament bugetar" as "any act by which a competent authority, according to law, allocates public funds to a specific destination, within approved budget credits." When the school signs a contract with a heating supplier for 2 million lei or hires teachers whose annual salaries will total 6 million lei, those become commitments—legal obligations that reserve budget capacity. **Article 2(3)** defines "angajament legal" as "the phase in budget execution representing any legal act from which an obligation results or could result against public funds." Crucially, **Article 4(3)** mandates: "Commitment of expenditures from these budgets is made only within approved budget credits"—you cannot legally commit more than your allocation.

**Plăți Efectuate** (Actual Payments) are the final and most important phase for visualization. **Article 2(35)** defines "payment of expenditures" as "the phase in budget execution representing the final act by which the public institution settles its obligations to third parties." This is real money leaving government accounts. **Article 52(6)** requires: "Making payments, within approved budget credits, is done only on the basis of supporting documents, prepared in accordance with legal provisions, and only after they have been liquidated and authorized." When the Treasury account transfers money to the heating supplier or deposits teacher salaries in bank accounts, that's a payment.

Your platform should focus predominantly on **Plăți Efectuate** because this represents actual cash disbursed, not just promised or reserved. **Law 500/2002, Article 57(b)** mandates that annual execution accounts must include "for expenditures: initial budget credits; definitive budget credits; payments made." This is the execution measure that matters for understanding where money actually went—some entities might have large commitments but poor payment execution, indicating implementation problems or cash flow constraints.

### Laws 500/2002 and 273/2006 provide the complete legal architecture

**Law 500/2002** on Public Finance establishes the fundamental principles governing Romania's entire budget system. **Article 1(1)** sets its scope: "This law establishes the principles, general framework and procedures regarding the formation, administration, commitment and use of public funds, as well as the responsibilities of public institutions involved in the budget process." The law defines every budget term used in execution reports (Article 2 contains 36 definitions), establishes the consolidated general budget concept (Article 3), mandates annual budget laws (Article 8), and creates the roles and responsibilities of credit authorizers (Articles 20-24).

Key provisions for transparenta.eu include **Article 29** on budget classification structure—revenues grouped by chapters and subchapters, expenditures by parts, chapters, subchapters, titles, articles, and paragraphs. **Article 52** details the expenditure execution phases. **Article 56** requires credit authorizers to prepare annual financial statements and performance reports. The law also establishes preventive financial control (**Article 24**) and internal audit systems (**Article 23**) to safeguard proper fund usage.

**Law 273/2006** on Local Public Finance applies these principles specifically to territorial administrative units. Its structure mirrors Law 500/2002 but addresses local specifics. **Article 1(1)** establishes its domain: "This law establishes the principles, general framework and procedures regarding the formation, administration, commitment and use of local public funds, as well as the responsibilities of local public administration authorities and institutions involved in local public finance."

Critical for understanding local budget flows, **Article 32** specifies the "defalcări" system—the mechanism by which locally-collected income tax is split with **47% going to the commune/city/municipality budget**, **13% to the county budget**, and **22% to a special equalization account. These defalcări are NOT transfers subject to consolidation elimination because they represent revenue-sharing at source, not budget-to-budget transfers. **Article 34** covers "transferuri consolidabile" (consolidable transfers)—funds moving from state budget to local budgets that must be eliminated during consolidation.

The law also establishes quarterly public reporting requirements (**Article 73**), mandating that primary credit authorizers present execution reports in public sessions before their deliberative authorities (local councils) in April, July, October, and December. This creates the transparency mechanism underlying public scrutiny of local spending.

## Pillar 2: Algorithmic Consolidation Logic

### Simple summation fails because the same money appears multiple times

The **Bugetul General Consolidat** (General Consolidated Budget) represents the aggregate of all component budgets consolidated to form a unified view of public finance. **Law 273/2006, Article 3(1)** explains: "Revenues and expenditures of budgets cumulated at the territorial unit level constitute the general budget which, after consolidation, through elimination of transfers between budgets, will reflect the dimension of public financial effort." The critical phrase is "după consolidare, prin eliminarea transferurilor"—after consolidation, through elimination of transfers.

Why can't you simply sum all rows in execution data? Because the Romanian government operates through hierarchical financing where money flows from central to local, from principal to secondary to tertiary authorizers, creating multiple recordings of the same funds. When the state budget transfers 100 million lei to a municipality for education, that amount appears as expenditure (Title 51) in state budget execution and as revenue (Chapter 42.02) in local budget execution. If you sum both uncritically, you count that 100 million twice—once as central spending and once as local revenue—even though it represents a single public effort.

Real-world data demonstrates this dramatically. In 2005 execution data, **eliminated at consolidation: 8,992.1 billion lei at revenues and 12,782.3 billion lei at expenditures**. These massive eliminations—representing transfers between government levels and institutions—would have grossly distorted the true public financial effort if left in. The consolidated budget shows what government as a whole collects and spends, not the internal accounting of money moving between government pockets.

The elimination process doesn't affect the deficit or surplus—it removes equal amounts from both sides of entities' budgets, leaving the net balance unchanged. What changes is the gross measure of government size and the accurate attribution of spending to ultimate purposes rather than intermediate transfers.

### Local consolidation eliminates transfers between mayors and subordinate institutions

Consider a municipality consolidating its general budget from the mayor's budget (Source A) plus all subordinate institutions—schools (Source E), hospitals (Source F), cultural centers (Source G), and other public entities. The algorithmic challenge: identify every transfer from the mayor to these institutions and eliminate both the expenditure at source and the revenue at destination.

**On the REVENUE side** (at subordinate institutions), eliminate these chapters:

**Chapter 42.02: Subvenții de la bugetul de stat** (Subsidies from state budget)—but only if the state budget component being consolidated includes these. For purely local consolidation, focus on Chapter 43.10.

**Chapter 43.10: Subvenții de la alte administrații** (Subsidies from other administrations)—this is the primary local elimination code. Key subcodes include **43.10.09** (subsidies for public institutions—the most common), **43.10.14** (subsidies for health capital expenditures), and **43.10.33** (subsidies to cover salary increases). When a school reports revenue under 43.10.09, this came from the mayor's budget and must be eliminated.

**On the EXPENDITURE side** (at the mayor's budget), eliminate these titles:

**Title 51: Transferuri între unități ale administrației publice** (Transfers between public administration units)—this entire title captures inter-governmental flows. It divides into two main articles:

**Article 51.01: Transferuri curente** (Current transfers) includes numerous alineats: **51.01.01** (transfers to public institutions—matches 43.10.09 at receiving institutions), **51.01.11** (transfers to health insurance fund), **51.01.36** (specific financial support), **51.01.38** (transfers for medical-social assistance units), **51.01.39** (financing for medical-social assistance), and many other purpose-specific codes for education, health, social assistance, and infrastructure.

**Article 51.02: Transferuri de capital** (Capital transfers) covers **51.02.15** (financing capital expenditures of pre-university education units—when the mayor funds school building repairs), **51.02.16** (transfers from National Development Fund), and **51.02.48** (transfers for health sector investments—when the mayor finances hospital equipment).

The consolidation formula operates as follows:

```
Step 1: Sum uncritically
Total_Revenue_Unconsolidated = Revenue_Mayor + Revenue_Schools + Revenue_Hospitals + Revenue_Others
Total_Expenditure_Unconsolidated = Expenditure_Mayor + Expenditure_Schools + Expenditure_Hospitals + Expenditure_Others

Step 2: Calculate eliminations
Elimination_Revenue = Sum(43.10.xx codes from all subordinate institutions)
Elimination_Expenditure = Sum(51.01.xx + 51.02.xx codes from mayor's budget)

Step 3: Apply consolidation
Total_Revenue_Consolidated = Total_Revenue_Unconsolidated - Elimination_Revenue
Total_Expenditure_Consolidated = Total_Expenditure_Unconsolidated - Elimination_Expenditure

```

In practice, **Elimination_Revenue will not exactly equal Elimination_Expenditure** due to timing differences. The mayor might have committed and booked the transfer as expenditure in December, but the school didn't receive and record it as revenue until January of the next fiscal year. These timing differences are normal in cash-basis accounting and should be accepted rather than forced into artificial balance.

Consider Bucharest Sector 1 consolidation as a concrete example. The mayor's budget shows 500 million lei revenue and 500 million lei expenditure. The 15 schools collectively report 120 million revenue and 120 million expenditure. The 3 hospitals report 80 million revenue and expenditure. Other institutions show 30 million. Unconsolidated totals: 730 million on both sides. But investigating the mayor's Title 51 expenditures reveals 60 million to schools (51.01.01), 40 million to hospitals (51.01.38), and 15 million to others—115 million total internal transfers. The schools' revenue shows 60 million at 43.10.09, hospitals show 40 million, others show 15 million. **Consolidated result: 730 - 115 = 615 million lei**, representing the true local public effort. That 115 million was being counted twice—once leaving the mayor's office, once entering subordinate institutions.

### Central consolidation follows identical principles for ministries and agencies

At central government level, ministries often have subordinate agencies, institutes, or directorates with separate legal personality and budgets. The Ministry of Health oversees numerous national institutes and hospitals. The Ministry of Culture has subordinate museums and cultural centers. Consolidating a ministry's budget with its subordinate agencies requires eliminating the Title 51 transfers from ministry to agency matched with the Chapter 42.02/42.10 subsidies received by agencies.

**At subordinate agencies (revenue side)**, look for **Chapter 42.10: Subvenții de la bugetul de stat pentru instituții specifice** (subsidies from state budget for specific institutions), particularly **42.10.11** (subsidies for hospitals) and **42.10.38** (subsidies for institutions financed from own revenues but receiving supplemental budget support).

**At the ministry (expenditure side)**, the same Title 51.01 and 51.02 codes apply—transfers to subordinate public institutions. The accounting structure mirrors local consolidation because both follow the same legal framework in Law 500/2002.

The key difference: central institutions often have more complex inter-agency relationships. An agency might receive funds from multiple ministries, or one ministry might coordinate programs involving other ministries' agencies. The consolidation perimeter must be clearly defined—are you consolidating just one ministry with its direct subordinates, or all of central government? The codes eliminated depend on which entities are inside the consolidation boundary.

### National consolidation aggregates all budgets while eliminating cross-level transfers

The Ministry of Finance performs the ultimate consolidation: combining all UATs (after local consolidation), all central institutions (after ministerial consolidation), social security budgets, special funds, and external financing into the **Bugetul General Consolidat** that appears in official reports and is transmitted to Eurostat.

This requires eliminating flows between budget levels, not just within levels. The primary cross-level flow: **transfers from state budget (Sector 01) to local budgets (Sector 02)**. These appear as Title 51 expenditures in central government execution and Chapter 42.02 revenues in local execution.

Specific codes for state-to-local transfers include numerous subcodes under **42.02.xx** covering different purposes: **42.02.10** (subsidies for education personnel), **42.02.11** (for hospitals), **42.02.14** (for education capital expenditures), and many others aligned with functional areas. Each corresponds to specific Title 51 codes in the state budget.

Another critical cross-level flow: **transfers from state budget to social security budget**. When the state budget covers social security deficits, this appears as **Article 51.01.69** (transfers to National Health Insurance Fund to cover deficit) in state budget expenditure, matched with corresponding revenue in FNUASS accounts. These must be eliminated to avoid counting the same public effort twice.

The national consolidation formula extends the local formula:

```
BGC_Revenue = (State_Budget_Revenue + Sum(Local_Budgets_Revenue_Consolidated) +
               Social_Security_Revenue + Special_Funds_Revenue + External_Funds_Revenue)
              - Eliminations_Cross_Level_Transfers

BGC_Expenditure = (State_Budget_Expenditure + Sum(Local_Budgets_Expenditure_Consolidated) +
                   Social_Security_Expenditure + Special_Funds_Expenditure + External_Funds_Expenditure)
                  - Eliminations_Cross_Level_Transfers

```

The eliminations capture every Title 51 code that has a corresponding recipient within the consolidation perimeter. Money transferred to entities outside Romania (foreign aid, international organization contributions) is NOT eliminated—those are genuine expenditures leaving the consolidated public sector.

### Edge cases require special treatment to avoid distorting results

**"Sume în curs de decontare"** (settlements in progress) represent amounts paid by one entity pending reimbursement from another. A municipality might pay for a project with understanding that the state budget will reimburse within 30 days. During that interim period, the amount appears as a receivable on the municipality's balance sheet. These are NOT eliminated during consolidation because they represent temporary financing arrangements, not budget-to-budget transfers. They appear in balance sheet accounts (assets/liabilities), not as Title 51 transfers or Chapter 42/43 revenues.

**Title 90/Code 98.02** covers surplus or deficit carryover from previous years. Each entity may start the fiscal year with accumulated surplus (excess revenue from prior year) or deficit (obligations exceeding resources). When consolidating, do NOT eliminate these. They represent each entity's opening financial position—net assets or liabilities brought forward. They're balance sheet items reflecting historical results, not current inter-governmental flows. Every entity's opening balance must be preserved in consolidated accounts.

**EU Funds (Titles 56, 58, 60, 61)** create complexity because they involve multi-stage flows. **Title 56.01** covers general transfers including EU co-financing. **Titles 58, 60, 61** track projects with external non-reimbursable financing (grants) and external loans. The consolidation rule: **eliminate only the Romanian inter-governmental component, not the external source**.

Consider an EU structural fund project: €10 million comes from EU, €5 million Romanian co-financing. The flow: EU → Ministry (as intermediary body) → Local municipality (beneficiary). The Ministry's budget shows €5 million from state budget as Title 51 transfer to the municipality. The municipality shows €5 million revenue at Chapter 42.02 (state co-financing) and €10 million at Title 58 (EU direct funding). During consolidation, eliminate the €5 million Romanian transfer (Title 51 ↔ Chapter 42.02), but preserve the €10 million EU component—that's genuine external revenue, not double-counted internal flow.

Co-financing arrangements between Romanian entities follow normal consolidation rules. If a county transfers 60% of project costs to a municipality for a hospital project, with the municipality covering 40%, eliminate the 60% transfer. The consolidated investment appears once at its total value (100%) in the municipality's capital expenditure, not split across two budgets.

## Pillar 3: Classification Dictionary for Visualization

### Functional classification answers "what is this money FOR"

Romania's functional classification follows **COFOG** (Classification of Functions of Government) structure, aligned through **Ordinul 1954/2005** (Order 1954/2005). The hierarchy: **Capitol** (Chapter—two digits) represents the broadest functional category, **Subcapitol** (Subchapter—four digits) adds intermediate detail, and **Paragraf** (Paragraph—six digits) provides line-item precision. In execution files, you'll see formats like "65.01.03" meaning Capitol 65 (Education), Subcapitol 01 (general education administration), Paragraf 03 (preschool and primary education).

**Capitol 51-56: Servicii Publice Generale** (General Public Services) encompasses the apparatus of government itself—Parliament, Presidency, ministries, local councils, administrative staff. **Subcapitol 51.01** covers the executive, legislative, and administrative core. **Subcapitol 53.01** funds fundamental research and development not attributable to specific sectors. **Subcapitol 55.01** contains debt service—interest payments and transaction costs on public debt. **Subcapitol 56.01** records general transfers between administrative levels (these are eliminated during consolidation). For public communication, describe this as "Running the Government" or "Administration Costs"—the overhead of having a functioning state.

Citizen label: "Roads and Transport"—highways, railways, airports, public transit.

### Economic classification answers "what is this money SPENT ON"

The economic classification structure uses **Titlu** (Title—two digits) for major categories, **Articol** (Article—four digits) for subcategories, and **Alineat** (Paragraph—six digits) for specific line items.

Citizen label: "Tax Revenue"—what citizens and businesses pay in taxes.

**Titles 30-39** record non-fiscal revenues. These include property income (interest earned on government deposits, dividends from state-owned enterprises, rent from government-owned real estate), sales of goods and services by public institutions (hospital fees, university tuition for non-subsidized programs, museum admissions), and fines, penalties, and confiscations. Public description: "Other Revenue"—non-tax government income.

**Titles 40-50** track transfers between government entities. **Title 40-42** covers general transfers—defalcări (revenue sharing) and subvenții (subsidies) from higher to lower levels. **Title 43-49** encompasses various current transfers. **Title 50** includes capital transfers. These are the codes that get eliminated during consolidation to avoid double-counting.

**Titles 56, 58, 60, 61** represent external financing. **Title 56.01** records funds from EU budget for administration. **Title 58.xx** tracks structural and cohesion funds—the major EU investments in Romanian development. **Title 60.xx** covers non-reimbursable external funds (grants from foreign governments and international organizations). **Title 61.xx** records external loan proceeds. Citizen label: "EU and Foreign Funding"—money from Brussels and international partners for development projects.

**Title 90** handles special budget operations. **90.01** records surplus carried forward from prior year. **90.02** shows deficit to be covered. **90.03** tracks loan repayments received (when government has lent money and borrowers repay).

### Mapping consolidated indicators to detailed execution codes creates clarity

Budget reports operate at two levels: high-level consolidated indicators for macro analysis and detailed execution codes for granular tracking. Understanding the correspondence between these levels enables proper aggregation and verification.

**Total Personnel Expenses** in a consolidated report maps to **all codes under Title 10**: summing 10.01.xx (all cash salaries), 10.02.xx (all in-kind benefits), and 10.03.xx (all employer contributions). When the quarterly report states "Personnel expenditures reached 50 billion lei," that's the aggregate of every Title 10 payment across all institutions. To verify or analyze this figure, filter execution data for Title = 10, sum all paragraphs, and cross-check.

**Operating Expenses** or **Current Expenditures** map to **Title 20: Bunuri și Servicii**. The consolidated indicator "Current expenses increased 8% year-on-year" means the sum of all 20.xx.xx codes grew by that percentage. Drilling down reveals which specific components drove the increase—was it utilities (20.01.03), travel (20.06.xx), or consulting (20.12)?

**Social Protection Expenditure** in macro reports combines **Title 57 economic classification with Capitol 68 functional classification**. Title 57 captures direct social assistance payments regardless of which institution disburses them. Capitol 68 encompasses all social protection functions including institutional care, administration, and support services beyond direct cash transfers. The intersection—Title 57 within Capitol 68—represents direct social benefits for social protection purposes, the purest measure of welfare spending.

**Capital Expenditure** or **Investment Spending** maps primarily to **Title 71: Active Nefinanciare**, particularly Article 71.01 (fixed assets). When analyzing investment trends, sum all 71.01.xx codes to see total capital formation. For EU-funded projects, also include **Titles 58, 60, 61** when they finance capital purposes—these appear as both revenue (external financing) and expenditure (the investment project itself).

**Debt Service** aggregates **Title 30 (interest) plus Title 81 (principal repayment)**. Macro reports stating "Debt service consumed 5% of budget" sum these two titles across all government levels. Breaking them apart reveals the cost of debt (Title 30—what we pay for having borrowed) versus repayment of borrowed principal (Title 81—paying back what we owe).

**FOREXEBUG execution files** structure data in hierarchical format: each row contains Capitol code (functional), Titlu code (economic), and the amount. A single record might show "65.01.03 / 10.01.01 / 50,000 lei" meaning "basic salaries (10.01.01) for preschool and primary education (65.01.03) totaling 50,000 lei." Aggregating to consolidated indicators requires summing across the appropriate dimension: sum all 10.xx.xx codes regardless of Capitol for total personnel, or sum all Capitol 65 codes regardless of Title for total education spending.

The mapping also reveals spending composition within functions. Education spending (Capitol 65) might be 60% personnel (Title 10), 15% operations (Title 20), 20% investment (Title 71), and 5% transfers (Title 51 to subordinate institutions). This breakdown helps assess efficiency—high personnel percentages suggest limited resources for investment; high Title 51 indicates decentralized execution through subordinate entities.

### Practical implementation requires understanding the complete code structure

When parsing FOREXEBUG XML files or processing budget execution PDFs for transparenta.eu, expect six-digit functional codes and six-digit economic codes: **XX.XX.XX / XX.XX.XX / Amount**. The first six digits identify WHERE (functional) and the second six identify WHAT (economic).

For public-facing visualizations, aggregate these detailed codes into user-friendly categories. Create a mapping table:

**Functional Groupings:**

- Administration (Capitols 51-56) → "Running Government"
- Security (Capitols 60-61) → "Defense and Police"
- Education (Capitol 65) → "Schools and Universities"
- Health (Capitol 66) → "Healthcare"
- Culture (Capitol 67) → "Culture and Sports"
- Social Protection (Capitol 68) → "Pensions and Social Support"
- Housing (Capitol 70) → "Housing and Water"
- Environment (Capitol 74) → "Environmental Protection"
- Agriculture (Capitol 83) → "Agriculture"
- Transport (Capitol 84) → "Roads and Transport"

**Economic Groupings:**

- Salaries (Title 10) → "Employee Pay"
- Operations (Title 20) → "Day-to-Day Costs"
- Interest (Title 30) → "Debt Interest"
- Subsidies (Title 40) → "Business Support"
- Social Benefits (Title 57) → "Welfare Payments"
- Investment (Title 71) → "Building Infrastructure"
- Debt Repayment (Title 81) → "Paying Back Loans"

This translation from technical classification to citizen language makes budget data accessible while preserving the ability to drill down to full granularity. A user might start viewing "Healthcare spending rose 10%" (Capitol 66 aggregate), then click through to see that "Employee Pay" (Title 10 within Capitol 66) drove most of the increase, then further drill to discover **10.01.33** (salary increases for medical personnel) was the specific driver.

The classification system's alignment with **ESA2010** (European System of Accounts) and **COFOG** (Classification of Functions of Government) enables international comparisons. Romania's Capitol 66 maps to COFOG 07 (Health), allowing direct comparison with other EU countries' health spending. The economic classification's conformity with ESA2010 ensures Romanian data integrates seamlessly into Eurostat databases, supporting cross-country analysis and EU-wide fiscal monitoring.

## Implementation Roadmap for Transparenta.eu

Building effective budget visualization requires implementing this architecture systematically. Start by obtaining FOREXEBUG execution data—either through official Ministry of Finance downloads from the transparency portal (mfinante.gov.ro/transparenta-bugetara) for aggregate data, or by requesting detailed XML files for complete institution-level analysis. The data arrives with Capitol/Titlu codes—immediately map these to functional and economic descriptions using the classification dictionary from Pillar 3.

Before aggregating or visualizing any data, implement the consolidation algorithms from Pillar 2. Identify the consolidation perimeter: are you showing a single municipality's consolidated budget, a county's aggregate, or national-level data? Apply the appropriate elimination rules: for local consolidation, eliminate Title 51 expenditures matched with Chapter 43.10 revenues; for national consolidation, eliminate all inter-level transfers including Title 51 ↔ Chapters 42-43. Never simply sum execution rows without first eliminating transfers, or your visualizations will show inflated figures representing double-counted money.

Focus visualizations on **Plăți Efectuate** (actual payments—column labeled "Plăți" or "Execuție de casă" in reports) rather than commitments or allocations. This shows real money disbursed, the true execution measure. When showing trends over time, ensure consistent classification—the Ministry of Finance occasionally updates codes via OMFP 1954/2005 amendments, requiring historical data recoding for valid comparisons.

Provide both aggregate views and drill-down capability. Display "Total Education: 45 billion lei (20% of budget)" using Capitol 65 sum, but allow users to click through to Subcapitol level (preschool, primary, secondary, university) and cross-tabulate with economic classification to show "Education Personnel: 30 billion (67% of education spending)" using Capitol 65 intersected with Title 10.

Build an educational layer explaining concepts transparently. When users hover over "Transfers Between Government Units (Title 51)," explain: "This is money moving from one government entity to another—like the Ministry of Education sending funds to local school boards. During consolidation, these transfers are eliminated to avoid counting the same money twice. They show coordination between government levels but don't represent final spending on citizens." This transforms technical data into civic education.

Validate your consolidation logic against official Ministry of Finance quarterly execution reports. Download the quarterly report PDF, extract the consolidated totals for revenues and expenditures, then verify your algorithm produces identical results when applied to the underlying detailed data. Discrepancies indicate either incorrect elimination rules or data quality issues requiring investigation.

Document limitations clearly. Note that FOREXEBUG data reflects cash-basis accounting (when money actually moved), which can differ from accrual-basis reporting (when obligations were incurred). Timing differences between commitment, liquidation, authorization, and payment phases mean that contracted projects might not show full execution until payment occurs, sometimes in subsequent fiscal years. Be transparent about these accounting realities rather than presenting false precision.

Consider creating standardized reports that replicate official formats while adding transparency features. Generate a consolidated budget execution summary matching Ministry of Finance structure, then add drill-down links, historical trend charts, per-capita calculations, international comparisons, and explanatory text. This positions transparenta.eu as both authoritative (matching official methodology) and accessible (adding context and usability).

The legal framework provides your authority: Law 500/2002 Article 56 mandates public reporting of budget execution; Law 273/2006 Article 73 requires quarterly public sessions on local budget execution. Your platform operationalizes this legal transparency requirement, making legally mandated public data actually accessible to the public rather than buried in PDFs or technical systems.

Romania's budget data tells the story of public priorities and governmental effectiveness. By implementing proper consolidation, using official classifications, focusing on actual payments, and translating technical categories into citizen language, transparenta.eu can transform raw FOREXEBUG data into genuine fiscal transparency—enabling citizens, journalists, and civil society to understand where their taxes go and hold government accountable for spending decisions.
