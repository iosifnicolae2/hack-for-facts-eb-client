# **Romanian Public Budget System: Architecture, Consolidation & Classification**

## **Pillar 1: Architecture of the Romanian Public Budget**

**Hierarchy of Budgets:** Romania’s public finances operate as a hierarchy of interconnected budgets. **Bugetul general consolidat (BGC)** – the General Consolidated Budget – is defined by law as *“the ensemble of all component budgets of the budgetary system, aggregated and consolidated to form a whole”*[legeaz.net](https://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/sistem-bugetar-national-romania#:~:text=Resursele%20publice%20se%20constituie%20%C5%9Fi,pentru%20a%20forma%20un%20%C3%AEntreg). In practical terms, this includes:

- The **State Budget (Bugetul de Stat)** – covering central government ministries and authorities.
- **Local Budgets (Bugetele Locale)** for each **unitate administrativ-teritorială (UAT)** – i.e. counties, municipalities, cities, communes (and the budgets of institutions subordinate to local authorities).
- The **Social Security Budget (Bugetul Asigurărilor Sociale de Stat, BASS)** – e.g. public pension fund.
- **Special Funds** – other standalone public funds, such as the National Health Insurance Fund, Unemployment Fund, and any extra-budgetary funds for specific purposes[legeaz.net](https://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/sistem-bugetar-national-romania#:~:text=C,proprii%20pentru%20un%20anumit%20obiectiv).
- **Other components** like budgets of autonomous public institutions (funded by own revenues), external credit funds, and external grants[legeaz.net](https://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/sistem-bugetar-national-romania#:~:text=Fac%20parte%2C%20de%20asemenea%2C%20din,externe%3B%20bugetul%20fondurilor%20externe%20nerambursabile).

All these are part of the national budget system and together form the BGC. A nested hierarchy exists: for example, *the State Budget includes the budget of the Education Ministry; the ministry’s budget includes a County School Inspectorate’s budget; the inspectorate’s budget includes a high school’s budget*[legeaz.net](https://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/sistem-bugetar-national-romania#:~:text=institutiilor%20subordonate). This nesting means higher-level budgets encompass the resources of subordinate entities.

**Relationship Between Budgets:** The State often transfers funds to lower levels – e.g. general and earmarked transfers from the state budget to local governments for education, social programs, etc. Local governments may also transfer portions of their budget to subordinate local institutions (schools, hospitals, etc.). These inter-budget transfers are later **eliminated in consolidation** (see Pillar 2) to avoid double counting[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=institutiei%20publice%20in%20care%20este,care%20se%20aloca%20bugetelor%20locale). In essence, the **General Consolidated Budget** is not a simple sum of all budgets, but a consolidated view where internal transfers are netted out.

**Budget Sectors (Sector Codes 01 vs 02):** Execution reports distinguish funding sectors. Generally, **Sector 01** denotes the State Budget, while **Sector 02** denotes Local Budgets (administrație locală)[sj.prefectura.mai.gov.ro](https://sj.prefectura.mai.gov.ro/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2022/02/Buget-2022.pdf#:~:text=CHELTUIELI%20CURENTE,)[uamssulita.ro](https://uamssulita.ro/wp-content/files/Raport_Inchidere_Venituri_Cheltuieli_30.06.2025.pdf#:~:text=,Inchidere%20Credit). For example, an expenditure line tagged *“Sector:01 – Bugetul de stat”* means it’s financed from the state budget, whereas *“Sector:02 – Bugetul local (administrație locală)”* indicates local government funding. In practice, a public institution may have Sector 01 allocations (if financed from the central budget) or Sector 02 (if financed by a local authority). This sector coding helps trace which level of budget is the source of funds.

**Key Actors – Ordonatori de Credite:** Public funds are managed through credit authorizing officers, classified by law in three tiers[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=Categorii%20de%20ordonatori%20de%20credite):

- **Ordonator principal de credite (Principal credit authorizer):** Typically ministers at the national level and mayors or county council presidents at the local level[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L684%20,Bucuresti%20si%20presedintii%20consiliilor%20judetene). They receive budget credits through the state or local budgets and have ultimate responsibility for those funds.
- **Ordonator secundar de credite (Secondary):** Heads of institutions with legal personality subordinated to a principal. For example, a County School Inspectorate or a county hospital director could be a secondary credit authorizer under the Ministry of Education or a County Council.
- **Ordonator terțiar de credite (Tertiary):** Heads of public institutions under a secondary (or sometimes directly under a principal) that do not further sub-delegate budgets. A school principal or local clinic manager is often a tertiary credit authorizer.

**Flow of Data from Tertiary to Principal:** Each public institution keeps its own budget (with own revenues and expenditures)[legeaz.net](https://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/sistem-bugetar-national-romania#:~:text=prezint%C4%83%20organizare%20ierarhic%C4%83,proprii%20%C5%9Fi%20resursele%20institutiilor%20subordonate), but their funding often comes via the parent institution. For example, a **school (terțiar)** receives allocations (subvenții) from its City Hall **Mayor’s Office (principal)**. In execution reports, the City Hall’s budget will show a transfer to the school, and the school’s budget will show that amount as revenue and then actual spending on salaries, goods etc. Secondary authorizers (if applicable) pass budget credits down to their tertiaries and approve their expenditures[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L703%20,din%20bugetele%20proprii%2C%20cu%20respectarea). Tertiary authorizers execute the budget for the specific services they manage (teaching in the school, in this example) using the funds allocated[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=,conditiile%20stabilite%20prin%20dispozitiile%20legale). Data flows upward in reports: the school reports execution to the city (principal), which consolidates it. The principal’s analysis must ensure that the school’s spending (e.g. on teacher salaries) and the transfer sent to the school are not double-counted in the consolidated local execution (see Pillar 2 on consolidation).

**Budget Lifecycle & Terminology:** Public budget execution goes through several phases:

- **Prevederi Bugetare (Budget Provisions/Appropriations):** These are the approved budget credits – the authorized limits of spending by category. They can be initial (from the annual budget law) and adjusted via rectifications. *Prevederi* essentially reflect the planned expenditures. (In legal terms, *credit bugetar* is “the maximum sum approved by budget up to which payments can be made in that year”[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=bugetare%3B%2018,din%20buget%20pentru%20celelalte%20actiuni) – this corresponds to prevederi.)
- **Angajamente (Commitments):** A two-step concept:
    - **Angajament legal (Legal commitment):** Any legal act (contract, order) that creates an obligation for public funds[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=2.%20angajament%20bugetar%20,natura%20unei%20cheltuieli%2C%20indiferent%20de). For example, signing a contract for school repairs is a legal commitment.
    - **Angajament bugetar (Budgetary commitment):** The administrative act of reserving funds from the budget for a specific purpose, within the limits of the approved credits[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=anul%20calendaristic%20care%20incepe%20la,subdiviziune%20a%20clasificatiei%20cheltuielilor%20bugetare). It “locks” that portion of the budget for the legal commitment.
- **Ordonanțare (Warranting/Ordering):** The authorization to pay, after verifying that goods/services were delivered.
- **Plăți Efectuate (Actual Payments):** The cash payments made to fulfill the obligations. These are the *executed expenditures* – the money actually spent. **This is the key metric** we visualize on platforms like *transparenta.eu*, as it shows the real cash outflows for public services.

In summary, an institution starts with *prevederi* (approved spending limits), makes *commitments* (commitments) up to those limits, and finally incurs *plăți efective* (actual payments). We focus on actual payments as the realized impact of the budget.

**Legal Basis:** The framework for budget structure and execution comes primarily from **Law 500/2002 on Public Finances** and **Law 273/2006 on Local Public Finances**. Key provisions include:

- **Defining the budget system:** Law 500/2002 (art. 2) and Law 273/2006 (art. 2) define components of the national public budget system and the general consolidated budget[legeaz.net](https://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/sistem-bugetar-national-romania#:~:text=Resursele%20publice%20se%20constituie%20%C5%9Fi,pentru%20a%20forma%20un%20%C3%AEntreg). All state, local, and social fund budgets are integrated under BGC.
- **Roles of ordonatori:** Law 500/2002 and 273/2006 specify the three categories of credit authorizers and their responsibilities. For instance, Law 273/2006 Article 21(2) explicitly states that *“ordonatorii principali de credite ai bugetelor locale sunt primarii UAT, primarul general al Bucureștiului, primarii de sector și președinții consiliilor județene.”*[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L684%20,Bucuresti%20si%20presedintii%20consiliilor%20judetene). They allocate funds to subordinates and oversee budget execution[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=Art.%2022.%20,aproba%20efectuarea%20cheltuielilor%20din%20bugetele).
- **Inter-budget transfers and consolidation:** Law 273/2006 provides that consolidation requires eliminating transfers between the budgets enumerated in art.1(2) to avoid double counting[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=institutiei%20publice%20in%20care%20este,care%20se%20aloca%20bugetelor%20locale). Similarly, Law 500/2002 echoes that the consolidated budget is calculated net of mutual transfers. These laws also regulate how state-to-local transfers are made (e.g. conditional grants for local development or social programs)[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=,interes%20national%2C%20judetean%20ori%20local).
- **Budget execution rules:** Law 500/2002 and 273/2006 establish that expenditures can only be made within approved credits and for their intended purpose[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=Art.%2023.%20,limita%20prevederilor%20si%20destinatiilor%20aprobate), and stipulate stages of budget execution (commitment, verification, payment, etc.) with internal control (preventive financial control, etc.).

By combining the legal framework with the data from execution reports (FXB files/PDFs), we can interpret who spends what money, under which budget, and how it flows through the public finance system.

## **Pillar 2: Algorithmic Consolidation – How to Aggregate without Double Count**

**Bugetul General Consolidat (BGC) – Definition & Importance:** The **general consolidated budget** is *not* a mere sum of all budgets. As defined in Law 500/2002, it is the aggregate of all component budgets **after eliminating transfers among them**[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=institutiei%20publice%20in%20care%20este,care%20se%20aloca%20bugetelor%20locale). This means any money moving from one public entity to another is counted only once. Simple summation would **overstate totals**, because, for example, a 100 lei transfer from the state to a city hall appears in state spending and in local revenue. BGC removes one side of such internal transactions. Thus, BGC reflects the **true size of government finances** in the economy – the final revenues collected and payments made to external parties.

**The “Elimination Matrix”:** To consolidate multiple levels, we must systematically net out reciprocal flows. At minimum, this involves identifying **transfer expenditures** in one budget and the matching **subsidy revenues** in another. The specific logic varies by level:

1. **Local Level (UAT consolidation):** A city or county’s consolidated local budget = *its own budget + subordinate institutions’ budgets – internal transfers*. In practice, the **Mayor’s Office budget** (often coded as Source “A” – financed entirely from the local budget) provides transfers to subordinated units like schools, social centers, museums, etc. These appear under **Titlul 51 “Transferuri între unități ale administrației publice”** in the city’s expenditure (e.g. “transferuri către instituții subordonate”)[static.anaf.ro](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/legislatie/L_9_2025.pdf#:~:text=,publice%20finan%C5%A3ate%20din%20venituri). Correspondingly, the subordinated institution (often coded with Source “G” – financing from own revenues + subsidies[djeptr.ro](https://djeptr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Anexa%20sinteza%20buget%202025.pdf#:~:text=Sector%3A%2002%20%E2%80%93%20Bugetul%20local,Titlul)[uamssulita.ro](https://uamssulita.ro/wp-content/files/Raport_Inchidere_Venituri_Cheltuieli_30.06.2025.pdf#:~:text=,Inchidere%20Credit)) will record a **subsidy revenue** from the local budget, typically under an indicator code in the 42 or 43 range (for “subvenții primite”). For example, a school might have income code 43.xx for “Subvenții din bugetul local” (subsidy from the local government). **When consolidating**, we eliminate:
    - The city’s transfer expenditure (Title 51) to that school.
    - The school’s corresponding subsidy revenue (code 43.xx)[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=institutiei%20publice%20in%20care%20este,care%20se%20aloca%20bugetelor%20locale).
        
        This ensures that, say, the 5 million lei that City Hall gave to schools is only reflected as the schools’ actual spending on salaries, utilities, etc., not double-counted as both city spending *and* school spending.
        
    
    **Which codes to eliminate?** Specifically, all expenditures under **Title 51 “Transfers between public administration units”** that go to subordinate local institutions are removed, along with the matching **subsidy revenues** those institutions record (common revenue codes for local subventions include 42.00.02 or 43.xx series, depending on classification updates, which denote transfers from other public administrations)[ceica.ro](https://www.ceica.ro/documente/e9828e6d2ee09fb03c67cec9ad2f93f5.pdf#:~:text=%3A,DE%20LA%20BUGETUL%20DE%20STAT)[primarie3.ro](https://www.primarie3.ro/images/uploads/consiliu_local/HCLS3_NR._187_DIN_22_.04.2024.pdf#:~:text=,Subven%C5%A3ii%20pentru%20institu%C5%A3ii). For example, a local execution might show **“transferuri către instituții subordonate” (Title 51)** in the city’s budget and **“subvenții de la bugetul local”** in the institution’s budget – these are netted out one-for-one.
    
    After elimination, we sum the *real* final outlays: e.g. teachers’ salaries, school utility bills, etc., appear just once in the consolidated UAT budget (funded ultimately by local taxes or state transfers, but not double-counted as an internal transaction).
    
2. **Central Level (Ministry and Agencies):** A similar approach is applied for a **ministry and its subordinated agencies**. Ministries (ordonatori principali) often transfer funds to subordinate institutions (ordonatori secundari/terțiari). For instance, the Ministry of Education’s budget includes transfers (Title 51) to universities or research institutes under it; those agencies record a subsidy income. In consolidation of the **Ministry’s general budget**, those internal transfers are canceled out. Total consolidated ministry spending will then reflect what was actually spent on goods, services, salaries, etc., across the ministry *and* its agencies, without double counting the inter-entity funding. Concretely:
    - Eliminate **Title 51 expenditures** in the ministry that correspond to financing its agencies.
    - Eliminate the agencies’ **revenues classified as transfers from the ministry** (these are often recorded under a specific revenue chapter for “subvenții de la bugetul de stat”).
        
        After elimination, **Total Income** of the consolidated ministry equals the state budget allocations to that ministry (tax funding, etc.), and **Total Expenditures** equal the sum of all final expenses of the ministry and sub-units. The **Deficit/Surplus** for that ministry’s sector is then actual income minus actual spending.
        
3. **National Level (All-government consolidation):** The Ministry of Finance aggregates *all* sub-budgets (central + local + social funds). At this level, **every inter-budget transfer must be purged**. Key eliminations include:
    - **State-to-Local transfers:** These are many, such as shared taxes and grants. For example, Title 51 at the state level might include **“Transferuri către bugete locale”** for national programs (education grants, local infrastructure, etc.), or subsidies (Code 43.x in local revenues)[ceica.ro](https://www.ceica.ro/documente/e9828e6d2ee09fb03c67cec9ad2f93f5.pdf#:~:text=%3A,DE%20LA%20BUGETUL%20DE%20STAT). These appear as spending in the state budget and revenue in local budgets – in the BGC they are removed.
    - **State to Social Fund transfers:** e.g. if the state budget subsidizes the public pension fund (BASS) or health fund (to cover deficits or special rights), that is state expenditure and social fund revenue which must cancel out in BGC.
    - **Local-to-local transfers:** uncommon, but if a county transfers funds to a commune (or via associations of local authorities), those too are internal and eliminated.
    - Essentially, any **Title 51 “Transfer” or Title 50/55 series** expense in one budget that is a **revenue in another public budget** is eliminated[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=institutiei%20publice%20in%20care%20este,care%20se%20aloca%20bugetelor%20locale). This leaves only **final revenues** (taxes, fees, EU funds, etc. coming from outside the government) and **final expenditures** (payments to third-party suppliers, employees, beneficiaries) in the consolidated totals.

**Edge Cases & Special Treatments:**

- **“Sume în curs de decontare” (Settlements in progress):** These are amounts that have been sent by one entity but not yet received/recorded by the other at the reporting date (e.g. end of year). They are essentially in-transit payments (recorded in accounting as intermediate clearing accounts). For consolidation, such amounts should not be treated as final expenditures or revenues since they haven’t fully left the government sector. Typically, they net out or are excluded to avoid timing distortions. In other words, if one budget shows an expense under this label and another hasn’t recorded the income yet, we ensure not to count it as a spend to outside the system. Once settled, they appear as normal transfers. The consolidation algorithm can ignore “in curs de decontare” entries or ensure they are paired off if still recorded on both sides at year-end.
- **Use of Surplus from Previous Years (Excedent) & Deficit Coverage:** Often local budgets finance a part of spending from accumulated surplus (excedent bugetar) from prior years (recorded under financing codes, e.g. **98.02 “Utilizare excedent din anii precedenți”**). Similarly, they might show financing from a prior surplus or loans to cover a deficit. **Important:** These are not new revenues from the economy, but rather use of past savings or borrowing. In consolidation, one must be careful:
    - **Surplus used**: It appears as a revenue source in that local budget execution, but it’s essentially money that was counted as revenue in a previous year (when it was originally collected). When consolidating at national level, financing items like 98.02 are usually *excluded from total revenues* to avoid inflating current revenues. They are shown separately as financing in fiscal reports, not as part of operating income[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=bugetare%20in%20cadrul%20unui%20exercitiu,operatiuni%20care%20se%20refera%20la)[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=28.%20excedent%20bugetar%20,platii%20cheltuielilor%20aprobate%20prin%20buget).
    - **Deficit coverage**: e.g. if a local government takes a loan (which might be recorded under code 98.01 or similar) or uses surplus, that covers the gap between revenues and spending. Consolidation focuses on actual expenditures; the loan is not counted as revenue in BGC (loans are financing, not income).
    - Thus, **Total Income in consolidation** counts only actual collected revenues (taxes, fees, grants from external sources), and **deficits** are the residual difference to expenditures. The **previous surplus used is effectively a financing item** and is not double counted as fresh income.
- **EU Funds (Titles 56, 58, 60, 61):** These titles correspond to projects financed by external non-reimbursable funds (e.g. EU structural funds, post-accession grants, the National Recovery Plan, etc.). Generally, **EU funds are external money**, so they don’t create internal double counting issues *unless* they pass through multiple budgets. Two scenarios:
    - *Direct funding:* If a ministry or local authority directly receives reimbursements from the EU, that income (often under specific revenue codes) and the related project spending (Title 58/60/61 for external-funded capital or operational projects) are final transactions. They remain in BGC, as they come from outside government and go to third-party contractors, etc.
    - *Through state budget:* Sometimes the national government pre-finances EU projects for local authorities or intermediates the flow (the EU reimburses the state, which then transfers to the local implementer). In such cases, the state budget will show an expenditure transfer to the local (likely under Title 51 or a dedicated transfer line), and the local will show an EU funds revenue. Here, **we eliminate the internal transfer** so that the EU grant is counted only once. Typically, we keep it where it is spent. For example, if EU money for a road is spent by a county, the consolidated view will show that spending in the county budget, financed by the EU, but not also as spending of the Ministry of Development.
    - In summary, **EU funds don’t require special logic beyond the normal transfer elimination**. They are treated as external revenues. Just ensure any intermediary transfers within the public sector (state to local co-financing, etc.) are netted. The actual EU-funded expenditures (Titles 56/58/60/61 which often map to specific project types) will appear in consolidated spending under the “Investments/Development” category (see Pillar 3).

By applying these consolidation rules, **Total Income** = sum of all distinct revenues actually collected by the public sector from the economy (taxes, EU grants, etc.), **Total Expenditure** = sum of all final expenditures to citizens, employees, suppliers, etc., and the **Budget Deficit** = Total Income – Total Expenditure (with a negative sign if expenditures exceed revenues)[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=15.%20consolidare%20,care%20se%20aloca%20bugetelor%20locale)[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=22.%20deficit%20bugetar%20,acest%20scop%20un%20inscris%20autentic). Each level (local, central, national) produces consolidated statements this way, which feed into the next level’s aggregation.

## **Pillar 3: Classification Dictionary – Functional & Economic Categories**

Understanding Romania’s budget execution data requires decoding the classification codes. There are two primary classification schemas:

- **Functional Classification** – what purpose the money serves (the *who/why* of spending).
- **Economic Classification** – what type of expense or revenue it is (the *what* is bought or paid).

### **Functional Classification (Who/Purpose)**

This classification groups expenditures by **functions** or sectors of public services, regardless of which authority spends the money. It has a hierarchy:

- **Capitol** (Chapter): Denoted by two-digit (or two-digit plus a .01/.02) codes, representing broad sectors.
- **Subcapitol** (Subchapter): Finer breakdown within a chapter.
- **Paragraf** (Paragraph) and sometimes **Subparagraf**: Detailed lines for specific programs or institutions.

For example, *Capitol 65* is **“Învățământ” (Education)**. This may split into subchapters like 65.01 (perhaps *Tertiary Education* for the Ministry) and 65.02 (*Pre-university Education* largely financed by local budgets). A specific paragraf under 65.02 could represent, say, *secondary education programs*.

**Top 10 Essential Functional Capitole and their meaning:**

1. **51 – Autorități Publice și Acțiuni Externe (Public Authorities and External Actions):** This covers general government administration, executive and legislative authorities, foreign affairs, diplomacy, etc. Essentially, the cost of running central and local government councils, plus external relationsancpi.ro.
2. **60 – Apărare (National Defense):** Military defense, national security services related to defense. (In some classification versions, defense is included in a broader code 60.x along with public order; however, commonly we see 60 for defense functions).
3. **61 – Ordine Publică și Siguranță Națională (Public Order and Safety):** Police, gendarmerie, border security, fire protection, courts, prisons – all internal security and judicial functions. (Often combined with defense as “Part II” of the budget)[primarie6.ro](https://primarie6.ro/primarie_sector6/sites/default/files/2021-11/Buget%20local.pdf#:~:text=,320).
4. **65 – Învățământ (Education):** All levels of education. This includes spending on schools, high schools, universities, and related educational programs. For simplicity, **Education** covers teacher salaries, school operations, etc., whether paid by the Ministry of Education or local town halls (local schools are under chap. 65.02 in local budgets)[mfinante.gov.ro](https://www.mfinante.gov.ro/static/10/Mfp/legislatie/clasificatie_economica/pdf/Anexa_nr6.pdf#:~:text=,Invatamant).
5. **66 – Sănătate (Health):** Healthcare services – hospitals, public health programs, emergency services, etc. It includes expenditures by the Ministry of Health, National Health Insurance Fund, and local authorities on health units. **Health** in budget terms spans both the state-funded programs and health insurance-funded expenses.
6. **67 – Cultură, Recreere și Religie (Culture, Recreation, and Religion):** Funding for cultural institutions (museums, theaters), sports and youth activities, parks, and religious affairs (such as support for churches or religious heritage). We label it **Culture & Recreation** for the public, encompassing arts, sports, and religious community services.
7. **68 – Asigurări și Asistență Socială (Social Security and Welfare):** This functional chapter covers **Social Assistance and Insurance** programs. It includes pensions (public retirement benefits), unemployment benefits, child allowances, disability aid, minimum income guarantee, etc.[b.prefectura.mai.gov.ro](https://b.prefectura.mai.gov.ro/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/buget_2021.pdf#:~:text=,Credite%20de). Essentially, it’s the social safety net and insurance schemes. (Note: Much of this is executed via the social security budget and local welfare offices.)
8. **70 – Locuințe, Servicii și Dezvoltare Publică (Housing and Community Amenities):** This includes public housing programs, local utilities and community infrastructure – e.g. water and sewer systems, public lighting, heating subsidies, urban development. We can describe it as **Housing & Utilities** – services that ensure communities have necessary amenities and housing support.
9. **74 – Protecția Mediului (Environmental Protection):** Spending on environmental conservation, waste management, water quality, pollution control, forestry, etc. **Environment** chapter covers environmental agencies and projects like green space maintenance, recycling programs, climate adaptation projects[gnm.ro](https://www.gnm.ro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aug.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%2074%2C01%20,137405%2F31.08.2016.%20SE%20APROB%C4%82)[mmediu.ro](https://mmediu.ro/buget-mmap-2016#:~:text=,62%20671).
10. **84 – Transporturi (Transportation):** Construction and maintenance of roads, highways, railways, public transport, airports, and so forth. **Transport** is a major economic development category, including national road infrastructure (often state-funded) and local road networks. Large capital projects like highway construction fall here, as well as subsidies for public transit.

*(Other notable chapters beyond these ten include Agriculture and Rural Development (usually chap. 83), Economic Development/Industry (various 80s codes), Communications (maybe 81), etc., but the above are the most visible to the public and cover the bulk of spending.)*

The functional classification helps answer “**What is the money spent for?**” In reports, you often see an expenditure line labeled by capitol and subcapitol, indicating the sectoral destination of funds. For instance, a salary payment at a school will carry the functional code 65.02 (education) even though economically it’s a salary (Title 10). This allows aggregation of all education spending across different institutions.

### **Economic Classification (What Type of Spending)**

The economic classification categorizes transactions by their economic nature. It answers “**What is the money spent on or received from?**”

**Hierarchy:**

- **Titlu (Title):** The broad category of expenditure or revenue (one-digit or two-digit code in execution files, often represented by two-digit codes in budgets). Titles group spending into major economic types.
- **Articol (Article):** A subdivision of a title giving a specific category.
- **Alineat (Line item):** A further breakdown of an article into detailed items.

For example, **Titlul I – Cheltuieli de personal (Title 10 – Personnel expenses)** is broken into articles like 10.01 “Salarii de bază” (base salaries), 10.02 bonuses, etc., and those may break into alineate for finer detailorniss.ro.

**Key Titles and “Real Economy” groups:**

In order to present the data in a more user-friendly way, we consolidate the many titles/articles into a few intuitive buckets:

- **Salaries (Personnel) – *Title 10*:** Denotes all spending on wages and employment-related costs for public sector staff. This includes base salaries, bonuses, allowances, contributions the employer pays, and other personnel expenditures. In execution files, any economic code beginning with **10** is a personnel expense. (E.g. 10.01.01 = base salary, 10.01.13 = per diems, etc.)orniss.ro. In reports, it might appear as *Titlul I Cheltuieli de personal – cod 10*[ubbcluj.ro](https://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/infoubb/documente_publice/files/iunie%202013/cont%20de%20executie%20anexa7.pdf#:~:text=172%2C035%2C130%2092%2C340%2C703%20172%2C035%2C130,78%2C722%2C355). This is essentially the government wage bill.
- **Goods & Services – *Title 20*:** This covers operational spending on non-staff inputs: office supplies, utilities, fuel, maintenance, travel, contracts for services, etc. All running costs of public institutions aside from salaries fall here. Execution codes starting with **20** correspond to these items (e.g. 20.01 might be office expenses, 20.05 utilities, etc.). It’s often labeled *Titlul II Bunuri și servicii – cod 20*[sgg.gov.ro](https://sgg.gov.ro/1/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NF-104.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20not%C4%83%20de%20fundamentare%20,%E2%80%93%20credite%20de).
- **Social Assistance & Pensions – *Title 57*:** This title (often called *“Asistență socială”* in budgets) covers social benefit payments made to individuals. It includes state pensions, welfare benefits, child allowances, disability payments, and other social support entitlements. In the consolidated budget, these are a large portion of spending. In execution data, codes beginning with **57** indicate such benefits (e.g. 57.02 might be pensions, 57.06 family allowances, etc.). Essentially, these are *cash transfers to citizens* for social protection. (Note: Some older classification versions used Title 55 or 56 for certain social expenses, but in the current format Title 57 is primary for assistance grants.)
- **Investments / Capital Development – *Title 71* (plus EU-funded project titles 56, 58, 60, 61):**
    - **Title 71 – Active nefinanciare (Non-financial assets):** This is capital expenditure from domestic funds – essentially government investment in infrastructure, equipment, buildings, land, etc. Any procurement or construction of long-term assets is recorded here. It’s commonly called **capital spending**. For example, building a road, school, or buying medical equipment falls under Title 71 in the execution (codes 71.xx.xx).
    - **Titles 56, 58, 60, 61 – External Funded Projects:** These titles are used for projects financed by external grants (primarily EU funds). They also represent capital or investment expenditures but are distinguished because the funding source is external. For instance, Title 58 might correspond to *“Programe cu finanțare nerambursabilă post-aderare”* (post-accession EU funded programs), Title 60/61 for other EU or international funded projects. In simplified terms, we can group **Title 71 and Titles 5x/6x** together as **Development/Investment Spending**, since all are used for building or acquiring assets (the difference lies in funding source). When educating the public, it’s useful to bundle these as “Investiții” – money spent on long-term development (roads, buildings, technology, etc.), whether funded by Romanian budget or EU grants.
- **Debt Payments – *Title 30 and Title 81*:**
    - **Title 30 – Dobânzi (Interests):** This includes interest payments on public debt (loans, bonds)[internationalbudget.org](https://internationalbudget.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/romania-202405131333.pdf#:~:text=presents%20the%20following%20core%20information%3A,on%20pages%20103%2C%20204%2C%20230). Whenever Romania’s government pays interest to creditors (domestic or external), it’s recorded under Title 30 (usually article 30.01 for internal debt interest, 30.02 external debt interest, etc.). It is part of current expenditures and contributes to the cost of debt servicing.
    - **Title 81 – Rambursări de credite (Loan Repayments):** This is a financing expense for repaying the principal of loans. For example, when a local government repays a portion of a bank loan or when the state repays a matured bond, it shows up as Title 81 in the execution (often under a specific chapter of debt). These are not operating expenses on services, but rather returning borrowed money – however, they appear in execution reports as outflows. We group Title 30 and 81 together as **“Debt Service”**: interest + principal repayments, i.e. the cost of government debt. (In budgets, interest is usually under operating section, and principal under financing section, but for the public it’s helpful to know both are debt-related outflows.)
- **(Other Economic Titles):** For completeness, there are other titles like **Title 40 – Subsidii (Subsidies)** which covers subsidies paid to enterprises (e.g. support for agriculture, public transport operators, energy price subsidies). Also **Title 50-series – Transferuri** (transfers) aside from 51, including current transfers and capital transfers to other entities (e.g. transfers to non-profits, between government units, to EU budget, etc.). These can be explained as needed, but in many visualizations they might be smaller or combined. For example, subsidy expenses (Title 40) could be shown separately as “Subsidies to industries” if significant (like subsidies to farmers or railway companies).

Using these groupings, one can present an **educational breakdown** such as: “For every 100 lei spent, X lei go to salaries, Y lei to goods and services, Z lei to social benefits, W lei to investments, and so on.” This helps the public see the budget in familiar terms.

**Mapping Table – Consolidated Indicators vs Execution Codes:**

Finally, here is a mapping of common consolidated budget categories (used in government macro-fiscal reports) to the specific execution code sections that feed them:

| **Consolidated Budget Indicator** | **Corresponding Execution Codes (Economic)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Venituri fiscale (Tax revenues)** | Codes 11.xx – 12.xx series (various tax categories in revenue) |
| **Contribuții de asigurări (Social contributions)** | Codes 14.xx (pension contributions, health insurance contributions) |
| **Alte venituri (Other revenues)** | Miscellaneous revenue codes (15.xx fines, 16.xx property income, etc.) |
| **Total Venituri Bugetare (Total revenues)** | Sum of all revenue codes except financing (codes 1x.xx except 19 or 98) |
| **Cheltuieli de personal (Personnel)** | Title 10 – All 10.xx.xx codes[ubbcluj.ro](https://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/infoubb/documente_publice/files/iunie%202013/cont%20de%20executie%20anexa7.pdf#:~:text=,93%2C312%2C775%2078%2C722%2C355) (wages, allowances, etc.) |
| **Bunuri și servicii (Goods & services)** | Title 20 – All 20.xx.xx codes[ubbcluj.ro](https://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/infoubb/documente_publice/files/iunie%202013/cont%20de%20executie%20anexa7.pdf#:~:text=,93%2C312%2C775%2078%2C722%2C355) (consumables, utilities, contracts) |
| **Dobânzi (Interest payments)** | Title 30 – 30.xx.xx codes (debt interest) |
| **Subvenții (Subsidies)** | Title 40 – 40.xx.xx codes (subsidies to companies, agriculture, etc.)[economie.gov.ro](https://economie.gov.ro/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Buget-2023-1.pdf#:~:text=,TITLUL%20VI%20TRANSFERURI) |
| **Asistență socială (Social assistance)** | Title 57 – 57.xx.xx codes (pensions, benefits to population) |
| **Alte transferuri (Other transfers)** | Title 50/51/55 – Fifty-series (transfers to other gov units, NGOs, EU, etc.) |
| **Proiecte cu fonduri externe (Externally funded projects)** | Titles 56, 58, 60, 61 – (EU funded project expenditures) |
| **Cheltuieli de capital (Capital investments)** | Title 71 – 71.xx.xx codes (acquisition of non-financial assets)[mt.ro](https://www.mt.ro/documente/acte-normative/2023/10_32/NF%20-23.10.2023.doc#:~:text=%5BDOC%5D%20NOT%C4%82%20DE%20FUNDAMENTARE%20,%28ii%29%20impozit%20pe) |
| **Total Cheltuieli (Total expenditures)** | Sum of all spending titles (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50… + 71 + etc., excluding 80s financing)[ubbcluj.ro](https://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/infoubb/documente_publice/files/iunie%202013/cont%20de%20executie%20anexa7.pdf#:~:text=,93%2C312%2C775%2078%2C722%2C355). In practice, current expenditures (Titlurile 10–59) + capital (Titlu 71) + sometimes financial operations. |
| **Deficit/Surplus (Cash)** | Calculated as Total Revenues minus Total Expenditures. (Financing items like Title 80/81 cover this gap – e.g., borrowing equals deficit)[mfinante.gov.ro](https://mfinante.gov.ro/static/10/Mfp/Scrisoarecadru2024/Scrisoareacadrubuget2024.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Scrisoare%20cadru%20,credite%20vor%20avea%20%C3%AEn). |

For example, the **Enacted Budget reports** and Fiscal Strategy documents often present expenditures by economic category – showing personnel, goods, interest, subsidies, transfers, social assistance, capital, and loan repayments as separate lines. Each of those corresponds directly to the summation of certain Titlu codes as above.

In an FXB execution file or a detailed PDF report, one can literally map: *“Cheltuieli de personal – cod 10”*[ubbcluj.ro](https://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/infoubb/documente_publice/files/iunie%202013/cont%20de%20executie%20anexa7.pdf#:~:text=,93%2C312%2C775%2078%2C722%2C355), *“Bunuri și servicii – cod 20”*, *“Asistență socială – cod 57”*, etc. By using this mapping, our platform will translate the raw code data into understandable categories (e.g. showing a pie chart of spending: X% on salaries, Y% on investments, etc., consistent with official budget categorizations).

**Conclusion:** By demystifying the hierarchical budget structure, the consolidation logic, and the classification codes, we bridge the gap between Romania’s raw administrative budget execution data and a transparent, comprehensible view for citizens. All these interpretations are rooted in the official public finance laws[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=15.%20consolidare%20,de%20angajament%20si%20credite%20bugetare)[avocatnet.ro](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol_5921/O-noua-lege-a-finantelor-publice-locale.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L684%20,Bucuresti%20si%20presedintii%20consiliilor%20judetene) and budget classifications issued by the Ministry of Finance, ensuring that the information presented is both accurate and legally grounded.
