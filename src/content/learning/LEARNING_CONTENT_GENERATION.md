## Automatic Execution Protocol

When user says **"Generate learning path on [topic]"**, automatically execute:

```
1. PHASE 1: RESEARCH — Learner analysis, domain mapping, content gap analysis
2. PHASE 2: DESIGN — Path architecture, learning objectives, scaffolding plan
3. PHASE 3: GENERATION — Create MDX lessons with interactive components
4. PHASE 4: REVIEW — Quality assurance, alignment verification, revisions
5. PHASE 5: OUTPUT — Generate path.json and all MDX files
```

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **All outputs follow platform structure**: `src/content/learning/paths/` and `src/content/learning/modules/`
2. **Bilingual content**: Every lesson must have both `index.en.mdx` and `index.ro.mdx`
3. **Bloom's Taxonomy objectives**: Every lesson has measurable learning objectives
4. **Gagné's Nine Events**: Every lesson follows the nine instructional events
5. **Cognitive load management**: Maximum 4 new concepts per lesson, 3-8 minute read time
6. **Interactive components required**: Every lesson includes Quiz, FlashCard, Hidden, or similar
7. **Retrieval practice**: Embed check-for-understanding throughout, not just at end
8. **Adult learning principles**: Honor autonomy, experience, relevance, problem-centeredness

</platform_constraints>
</context>

<design_framework>

## STEP 1: DEFINE PATH-LEVEL OUTCOMES

What will learners be able to do after completing this entire path?

<path_outcomes>
Write 3-5 path-level outcomes using this template:
"By completing this path, learners will be able to [ACTION VERB at ANALYZE/EVALUATE/CREATE level]
[SPECIFIC OUTCOME] [IN CONTEXT] [TO WHAT END]."

Example:
"By completing this path, learners will be able to ANALYZE local government budgets
to identify potential red flags and formulate questions for public officials."
</path_outcomes>

## STEP 2: STRUCTURE MODULES (Cognitive Load Theory)

Break the path into modules that manage cognitive load:

<module_design>
For each module:

MODULE [N]: [Title]
- Learning focus: [What cognitive territory does this cover?]
- Prerequisite modules: [Which modules must come before?]
- Duration: [Total minutes]
- Number of lessons: [3-7]

INTRINSIC LOAD MANAGEMENT:
- What are the 3-5 core concepts for this module?
- How do they build on each other within the module?
- What's the complexity ceiling?

EXTRANEOUS LOAD REDUCTION:
- What tangential information should be excluded?
- How will formatting support comprehension?
- What consistent patterns will be used?

GERMANE LOAD OPTIMIZATION:
- How will lessons connect to prior knowledge?
- What elaborative prompts will be included?
- Where will retrieval practice occur?
</module_design>

## STEP 3: DEFINE LESSON OBJECTIVES (Bloom's Taxonomy)

For each lesson, define specific, measurable objectives:

<bloom_levels>
REMEMBER: Define, list, identify, name, recall, recognize
  → Use for: Terminology, facts, classifications
  → Assessment: Definition matching, fill-in-blank, true/false

UNDERSTAND: Explain, describe, summarize, interpret, compare, classify
  → Use for: Concepts, processes, relationships
  → Assessment: Explain why, compare/contrast, categorize

APPLY: Use, implement, solve, demonstrate, calculate, apply
  → Use for: Procedures, calculations, practical tasks
  → Assessment: Solve problem, calculate value, apply rule

ANALYZE: Differentiate, organize, compare, examine, question
  → Use for: Data interpretation, pattern recognition, anomaly detection
  → Assessment: Analyze data, identify patterns, find inconsistencies

EVALUATE: Judge, critique, assess, justify, recommend
  → Use for: Decision-making, quality assessment, prioritization
  → Assessment: Evaluate options, justify choice, recommend action

CREATE: Design, construct, produce, propose, formulate
  → Use for: Projects, recommendations, action plans
  → Assessment: Create plan, design solution, propose approach
</bloom_levels>

Write objectives using this template:
"By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to [ACTION VERB]
[SPECIFIC CONTENT] [CONTEXT/CONDITIONS] [MEASURABLE CRITERION]."

## STEP 4: SEQUENCE LESSONS (Gagné's Nine Events)

Plan how each lesson will implement the nine instructional events:

<gagne_sequence>
For each lesson, specify:

LESSON [N.N]: [Title]
Duration: [X] minutes
Objective: [From Step 3]
Completion mode: [quiz / mark_complete]

1. GAIN ATTENTION
   Hook type: [question / surprising fact / scenario / problem]
   Hook content: [Specific hook planned]

2. INFORM OBJECTIVES
   Statement: "After this lesson, you'll be able to..."

3. STIMULATE RECALL
   Prior connection: [What prior knowledge to activate]
   Recall activity: [Question or prompt to trigger recall]

4. PRESENT CONTENT
   Chunks: [Number of content chunks, 200-300 words each]
   Chunk topics: [What each chunk covers]
   Examples planned: [Specific examples to include]

5. PROVIDE GUIDANCE
   Worked examples: [Yes/No, what type]
   Mnemonics: [Any memory aids]
   Key patterns: [What to highlight]

6. ELICIT PERFORMANCE
   Practice type: [Quiz / Hidden reveal / Calculator / FlashCard]
   Practice content: [What will be practiced]
   Support level: [Full / Partial / Minimal]

7. PROVIDE FEEDBACK
   Feedback approach: [Explanation for all options / Corrective / Confirmatory]

8. ASSESS PERFORMANCE
   Assessment type: [Quiz at end / Cumulative / None]
   Alignment check: [Does assessment match objective?]

9. ENHANCE RETENTION & TRANSFER
   Summary approach: [Key takeaways / Blockquote / Checklist]
   Transfer activity: [Real-world connection / Next steps]
   Next lesson preview: [Connection to next lesson]
</gagne_sequence>

## STEP 5: APPLY ADULT LEARNING PRINCIPLES (Andragogy)

Verify each lesson honors adult learning principles:

<andragogy_checklist>
For each lesson, confirm:

□ AUTONOMY
  - Does the lesson respect learner intelligence?
  - Is tone conversational, not condescending?
  - Are choices offered where appropriate?

□ EXPERIENCE
  - Does the lesson acknowledge what learners may already know?
  - Are examples relevant to their professional context?
  - Does content build on prior experience, not ignore it?

□ RELEVANCE
  - Is "why this matters" explicitly explained?
  - Are real-world applications included?
  - Will learners see immediate value?

□ PROBLEM-CENTERED
  - Is content framed around solving problems?
  - Are scenarios realistic and relatable?
  - Does the lesson help with decisions learners actually face?

□ INTERNAL MOTIVATION
  - Does the lesson connect to learner goals?
  - Are achievements recognized?
  - Is progress visible?

□ RESPECT
  - Is language respectful and professional?
  - Are diverse perspectives included?
  - Is content culturally appropriate for Romania?
</andragogy_checklist>

## STEP 6: PLAN RETRIEVAL PRACTICE (Learning Science)

Design spaced retrieval into the path:

<retrieval_plan>
WITHIN-LESSON RETRIEVAL:
- 2-3 check-for-understanding questions per lesson
- Prediction prompts before revealing information
- Self-explanation prompts after examples

ACROSS-LESSON RETRIEVAL:
- Each lesson starts with 1-2 recall questions from prior lessons
- FlashCardDeck components for cumulative review
- Interleaved practice mixing concepts from different lessons

INTERLEAVING:
- How will practice problems mix concept types?
- Where will "which approach applies?" discrimination questions appear?

SPACING:
- How is content spaced to optimize retention?
- Where are review opportunities built in?
</retrieval_plan>

## STEP 7: CREATE SCAFFOLDING PLAN

Design how support fades across the path:

<scaffolding_design>
EARLY LESSONS (Full Support):
- Complete worked examples with all steps shown
- Explicit hints and guidance
- Metacognitive prompts ("Notice that...")
- Maximum interactive support

MIDDLE LESSONS (Partial Support):
- Similar problems with some steps removed
- Guiding questions instead of explicit steps
- Self-check prompts ("Why did we...?")
- Reduced scaffolding

LATER LESSONS (Minimal Support):
- Novel problems with only initial guidance
- Learner completes independently
- Reflection prompts ("What strategy did you use?")
- Transfer to new contexts

FINAL LESSONS (Independent):
- New context/transfer problems
- No scaffolds provided
- Real-world application scenarios
</scaffolding_design>

</design_framework>

```

## CONTENT STRUCTURE (Implementing Gagné's Nine Events)

### Section 1: HOOK (Gain Attention)

**Purpose**: Create curiosity that the lesson will satisfy.

Requirements:

- Open with a question, surprising fact, relatable scenario, or problem
- Create a curiosity gap
- Maximum 2-3 sentences
- Use direct address ("You might wonder..." / "Imagine...")
- Connect to learner's real experience

Good examples:

- "What if you could spot a €10,000 error in a budget document in under 30 seconds?"
- "Every time you buy coffee, you're contributing to the national budget. But where does that money actually go?"
- "Last year, a citizen in Timișoara noticed something odd in their city's budget..."

Bad examples (avoid):

- "In this lesson, we will discuss..."
- "Budget classification is an important topic..."
- "It is widely known that..."

### Section 2: OBJECTIVES (Inform Objectives)

**Purpose**: Set clear expectations for what learners will accomplish.

Requirements:

- State what learners will be able to do (not what they'll "learn about")
- Keep to 1-2 clear, measurable outcomes
- Use action verbs

Format:
> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:**
>
> - [Action verb] [specific skill/knowledge] [in context]

### Section 3: CONNECTION (Stimulate Recall)

**Purpose**: Activate prior knowledge that new learning will build on.

Requirements:

- Link to prerequisite lesson content OR general prior knowledge
- Use a recall prompt if appropriate
- Keep brief (2-3 sentences)

Approaches:

- "Remember when we explored [prior concept]? Today we'll build on that..."
- <Hidden trigger="Quick check: What is [prior concept]?">[Brief answer]</Hidden>
- "You already know that [familiar concept]. This lesson shows how..."

### Section 4: CORE CONTENT (Present Content + Provide Guidance)

**Purpose**: Deliver new knowledge in digestible, scaffolded chunks.

Requirements:

- Break into 2-4 chunks (200-300 words each)
- Use subheadings (## or ###) for each major concept
- Maximum 4 new concepts per lesson

For each chunk include:

- Clear explanation with concrete examples
- Analogy connecting to familiar concepts (when helpful)
- Non-examples for contrast (what it is NOT)
- Visual cues (bold key terms, use lists for 3+ items)

After each chunk include:

- Check-for-understanding (Hidden reveal, prediction, or quick question)
- Self-explanation prompt ("Why do you think...?" / "Notice that...")

Worked example format (for procedural content):

```
**Example: [Title]**

*Situation*: [Realistic context]

*Step 1*: [What to do] — [Why]
*Step 2*: [What to do] — [Why]
*Step 3*: [What to do] — [Why]

*Result*: [Outcome and what it means]
```

### Section 5: PRACTICE (Elicit Performance + Provide Feedback)

**Purpose**: Let learners apply what they've learned with supportive feedback.

Requirements:

- Include at least one interactive component
- Provide feedback that explains WHY, not just right/wrong
- Match the cognitive level of the objective

Component selection guide:

- Testing understanding → Quiz (4 options, one correct)
- Self-assessment → Hidden reveal
- Terminology → FlashCardDeck
- Calculations → Calculator component
- Predictions → Hidden with reveal

### Section 6: SUMMARY (Assess + Enhance Transfer)

**Purpose**: Consolidate learning and connect to real-world application.

Requirements:

- Recap 2-3 key takeaways (use blockquote)
- Connect to real-world application ("Next time you...")
- Preview next lesson (if applicable)
- End with completion component

Format:
> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - [Takeaway 1]
> - [Takeaway 2]
> - [Takeaway 3]

**Try This**: [Real-world mini-challenge or application suggestion]

[Preview of next lesson if applicable]

<MarkComplete label="Mark Lesson Complete" />

## WRITING GUIDELINES

<voice_and_tone>
CONVERSATIONAL BUT PROFESSIONAL:

- Use "you" and "your" (direct address)
- Write as a knowledgeable colleague, not a lecturer
- Active voice preferred
- Confident without being condescending

EXAMPLES:
✓ "You'll recognize this pattern in most municipal budgets."
✓ "Let's break this down step by step."
✓ "This might seem complex at first, but there's a simple logic behind it."

✗ "It should be noted that learners will encounter this pattern."
✗ "One must understand that budgets contain..."
✗ "As we all know, budgets are important."
</voice_and_tone>

<clarity_rules>
PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE:

- Maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- One idea per paragraph
- Use blank lines between paragraphs

LISTS:

- Use bullet lists for 3+ items
- Use numbered lists for sequences/steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure

TERMINOLOGY:

- Define jargon when first introduced
- Bold key terms on first use
- Use consistent terminology (match existing lessons)

SENTENCE VARIETY:

- Mix sentence lengths
- Use questions to maintain dialogue
- Start sentences with different words
</clarity_rules>

<engagement_techniques>
QUESTIONS:

- Rhetorical questions to prompt thinking
- Prediction questions before reveals
- Self-check questions after explanations

EXAMPLES:

- Use specific, concrete examples (not "for example, things like...")
- Include Romanian context (cities, institutions, amounts in RON/EUR)
- Reference the Transparenta.eu platform where relevant

ANALOGIES:

- Connect to everyday experiences
- Use familiar Romanian contexts
- Keep analogies simple (don't overextend)
</engagement_techniques>

<constraints>
NEVER USE:
- "It's important to note that..."
- "It should be mentioned that..."
- "As we all know..."
- "In this lesson, we will discuss..."
- "In conclusion..."
- Unnecessary adverbs (very, really, actually, basically)
- Passive voice where active is clearer

NEVER INCLUDE:

- Time estimates in prose ("This will take 5 minutes...")
- Content beyond lesson scope (tangents)
- Placeholder text ("[example]", "[insert here]")
- Empty phrases that don't add information

ALWAYS INCLUDE:

- Concrete examples with specific numbers/names
- Romanian context where applicable
- At least one interactive component
- Completion component at the end
</constraints>

</content_requirements>

<interactive_components>

## Quiz Component

```jsx
<Quiz
  id="unique-quiz-id"
  question="Question text here?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Option A text", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Option B text", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Option C text", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Option D text", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Explanation shown after answering. Explain why B is correct.
               Also explain why A, C, and D are incorrect—address common
               misconceptions. Keep to 2-3 sentences."
/>
```

**Quiz Design Rules:**

- Exactly 4 options
- One clearly correct answer
- All distractors plausible (common misconceptions, partial truths, related concepts)
- Never use "all of the above" or "none of the above"
- Never use negative framing ("Which is NOT...")
- Question tests the lesson objective, not trivia
- Explanation addresses ALL options, not just the correct one

**Quiz Question Patterns:**

*Concept Recognition:*
"Which of the following BEST describes [concept]?"

*Application:*

## Phase 4: Review Agent

### Purpose

Validate generated content against quality criteria, pedagogical best practices, and platform requirements.

### Review Agent Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a senior instructional designer and quality assurance specialist.
Your task is to review AI-generated educational content for pedagogical
effectiveness, accuracy, alignment, and platform compliance.
</role>

## Appendix B: Quiz Anti-Patterns

**Never do:**

- "All of the above" → Learners guess by counting familiar options
- "None of the above" → Frustrating, doesn't test understanding
- "Which is NOT..." → Confusing, increases cognitive load
- Obvious wrong answers → Reduces to 2-3 options
- Trick questions → Damages trust, tests reading not learning
- Verbatim recall → Tests memorization not understanding

**Always do:**

- Plausible distractors based on common misconceptions
- One clearly best answer (not debatable)
- Positive framing ("Which IS..." not "Which is NOT...")
- Application or analysis, not just recall
- Explanation for ALL options after answer

---

## Appendix C: Romanian Localization Checklist

When generating Romanian versions:

- [ ] Title: Natural Romanian phrasing (not literal translation)
- [ ] Examples: Use Romanian cities, institutions, amounts (RON/EUR)
- [ ] Legal terms: Use official Romanian fiscal/budget terminology
- [ ] Acronyms: UAT, CFP, ANAF, MFP not US/UK equivalents
- [ ] Currency: RON with EUR equivalents where helpful
- [ ] Laws: Reference Romanian legislation (Legea finanțelor publice)
- [ ] Tone: Same conversational but respectful tone
- [ ] Idioms: Adapt to Romanian equivalents, don't translate literally
