# From Anomaly to Story

## Concept Introduction

Finding something unusual in budget data is just the beginning. An anomaly is not a story — it's a lead. The journey from "this looks odd" to "we can publish this" requires systematic verification, pattern recognition, and multiple sources.

Too many would-be investigations fail because journalists confuse the starting point with the finish line. The investigation funnel keeps you honest about where you actually are.

> **Key Insight:** Anomalies are LEADS, not conclusions. Never publish an anomaly without verification and context.

### Component Specification

```typescript
interface InvestigationFunnelProps {
  readonly stages: ReadonlyArray<{
    id: 'anomaly' | 'pattern' | 'verified' | 'story'
    title: string
    description: string
    status: string
    example: string
    verificationSteps: string[]
    redFlags: string[]
    nextSteps: string[]
  }>
  readonly onStageSelect: (stageId: string) => void
}

interface InvestigationFunnelState {
  selectedStage: string | null
  expandedDetails: boolean
  viewedStages: Set<string>
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Funnel visualization with 4 stages, narrowing visually
- Click on any stage expands detailed view below funnel
- Expanded view shows: examples, verification steps, red flags, next steps
- Animation: Data "flows" down funnel when user progresses
- Progress tracking: mark stages as "understood"
- Color progression: gray → yellow → blue → green as evidence strengthens

**Accessibility:**
- Stages are focusable and activatable via keyboard
- `aria-expanded` for expanded details
- Visual hierarchy conveyed through text as well as color

## Core Explanation

### The Verification Triangle

To move from anomaly to story, you need three types of evidence:

```
                    📊 DATA
                       ╱╲
                      ╱  ╲
                     ╱    ╲
                    ╱ STORY ╲
                   ╱          ╲
                  ╱────────────╲
             📄 DOCUMENTS    👤 SOURCES
```

| Evidence Type | What It Provides | Examples |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Data** | The pattern | Budget execution rates, contract values, spending trends |
| **Documents** | The mechanism | Meeting minutes, procurement files, internal memos |
| **Sources** | The context | Officials who explain why, whistleblowers who confirm |

A complete story requires all three. Data alone is suggestive. Documents alone are incomplete. Sources alone are unverified. Together, they're publishable.

### Common Traps to Avoid

#### Trap 1: Publishing Anomalies as Stories

**Bad:** "Ministry X spent only 40% of infrastructure budget!"

**Problem:** No context. Maybe projects were delayed due to legitimate permits. Maybe funding was reallocated by Parliament. The anomaly is real; the implication is unverified.

**Better:** Investigate why, then report the verified finding.

#### Trap 2: Confusing Correlation with Causation

**Bad:** "Minister's brother got contract right after minister took office!"

**Problem:** Timing suggests connection but doesn't prove it. The brother might be a legitimate contractor who won on merit.

**Better:** Show the process was manipulated, not just that the outcome looks suspicious.

#### Trap 3: Single-Source Stories

**Bad:** "According to our source, there was bribery..."

**Problem:** One source can be wrong, biased, or have personal motives.

**Better:** Verify with documents and at least one additional independent source.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="funnel-stage-quiz"
  question="You find that a municipality consistently awards street-lighting contracts to the same company for 5 years, at prices 30% above market rate. What stage of the investigation funnel are you at?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Anomaly — this is just one data point", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Pattern — systematic repetition suggests something meaningful", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Verified Facts — the pattern proves wrongdoing", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Story — this is ready to publish", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is a PATTERN: repeated behavior (same company, 5 years) with suspicious characteristics (30% above market). But it's not yet verified — maybe there are legitimate reasons (specialized equipment, performance guarantees). And it's not a story until you verify the mechanism (how did this happen?) and confirm with documents/sources."
/>

<Quiz
  id="verification-triangle-quiz"
  question="You have budget data showing underspending and a source claiming it's due to corruption. What's missing from your verification triangle?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "More data points", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Additional sources", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Documents showing the mechanism", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Nothing — this is enough to publish", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="You have DATA (budget showing underspending) and a SOURCE (claiming corruption). You're missing DOCUMENTS that explain the mechanism — how the corruption allegedly worked. Without documents, you have an accusation supported by suggestive data, but not proof of the claim."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Move through the funnel systematically: Anomaly → Pattern → Verified Facts → Story. Each stage requires more evidence. Never skip steps. The verification triangle (data + documents + sources) is your quality control.
