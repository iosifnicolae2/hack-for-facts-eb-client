# Your First Lead

## Concept Introduction

Theory is important, but investigation skills are built through practice. In this lesson, you'll apply everything you've learned — follow the money, ethical considerations, the investigation funnel — to find your first real lead.

A lead isn't a story. It's a starting point worth pursuing. Your goal is to find something unusual, document what you see, and formulate the questions you'd need to answer to move it down the investigation funnel.

> **Key Insight:** The best way to learn investigative journalism is to investigate. Start small, document carefully, and build your skills with each lead you pursue.

      target?: string
      placeholder?: string
    }
    hint?: string
  }>
  readonly documentationFields: ReadonlyArray<{
    id: string
    label: string
    type: 'text' | 'number' | 'percentage' | 'currency'
    required: boolean
  }>
  readonly onSaveLead: (leadData: LeadDocumentation) => void
}

interface LeadDocumentation {
  category: string
  entity: string
  executionRate: number
  plannedAmount: number
  actualSpent: number
  gap: number

## Core Explanation

### What Makes a Good Lead?

Not every anomaly is worth investigating. A good lead has:

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Significant gap** | Small variances might be rounding; large gaps (>30%) suggest real issues |
| **Public interest** | Involves taxpayer money, public services, or accountability |
| **Verifiable** | You can realistically obtain documents and sources |
| **Proportionate** | The story would be worth the investigation effort |

### Types of Leads in Budget Data

1. **Execution Rate Anomalies**
   - Very low execution (below 50%): Why wasn't money spent?
   - Very high execution (>100%): Where did extra money come from?

2. **Year-over-Year Changes**
   - Sudden drops: Did a priority disappear?
   - Sudden spikes: Emergency or opportunism?

3. **Category Comparisons**
   - Peer institutions with vastly different spending
   - Costs per unit (per student, per patient) that vary widely

4. **Timing Patterns**
   - Year-end spending surges
   - Pre-election spending increases

### Moving from Lead to Investigation

Once you have a lead, the next steps are:

1. **Expand the data** — Is this pattern isolated or widespread?
2. **Request documents** — Use Law 544/2001 to request procurement files, meeting minutes
3. **Identify sources** — Who would know why this happened?
4. **Apply ethics check** — Is this worth investigating proportionately?

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="good-lead-quiz"
  question="You find that a county hospital has 45% execution on capital investments, while neighboring county hospitals are at 80%+. Is this a good lead?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "No — 45% isn't that unusual for capital investments", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Yes — the gap with peers suggests something specific to this hospital worth investigating", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "No — hospitals are too complex to investigate", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Yes — this proves the hospital is corrupt", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is a GOOD LEAD because: (1) There's a significant gap with comparable institutions, (2) It involves public health infrastructure (clear public interest), (3) It's specific enough to investigate (one hospital, one budget line). It doesn't prove anything yet — that's why it's a lead, not a story."
/>

<Quiz
  id="next-steps-quiz"
  question="You've documented a lead: a ministry with 35% execution on IT modernization funds. What should you do FIRST?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Publish an article about the ministry's failure", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Check if this pattern repeats in previous years and similar ministries", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "File a criminal complaint", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Call the minister for an interview", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="First, expand the data: Does this pattern repeat? Is it unique to this ministry or common across government? This moves you from 'anomaly' toward 'pattern' in the investigation funnel. Contacting sources comes after you understand the scope."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** A lead is a starting point, not a destination. Document what you find (category, entity, numbers, gap), formulate investigation questions (why, what documents, who to contact), and remember: this is an anomaly until you verify it with patterns, documents, and sources.
