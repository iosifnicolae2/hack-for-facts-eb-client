# Ethical Foundations

## Concept Introduction

Finding an anomaly in budget data is exciting. But before you start investigating, you need to answer a fundamental question: **Should you?**

Ethical journalism isn't about avoiding hard stories — it's about ensuring your investigation serves the public interest, uses proportionate methods, and treats all parties fairly. An ethics check before you begin protects both your subjects and your credibility.

> **Key Insight:** The best investigative journalists don't just ask "Can I publish this?" They ask "Should I, and how should I do it ethically?"

## Core Explanation

### The Four Pillars of Ethical Investigation

#### 1. Public Interest

The strongest justification for any investigation is genuine public benefit:

| Strong Public Interest | Weak Public Interest |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Misuse of taxpayer funds | Personal disputes |
| Safety/health risks | Celebrity gossip |
| Democratic accountability | Private business matters |
| Systematic corruption | Individual embarrassment |

**The test:** Could you explain to any citizen why this matters to them?

#### 2. Proportionality

Match your methods to the seriousness of the issue:

| Issue Size | Appropriate Response |
|------------|----------------------|
| Billions of RON, public safety | Full investigation, months of work |
| Millions of RON, procedural issues | Focused inquiry, weeks of work |
| Thousands of RON, minor irregularities | Quick verification, transparency request |

Don't use a sledgehammer on a nail. Disproportionate scrutiny can cause unjust harm.

#### 3. Right of Reply

**Non-negotiable principle:** Before publishing allegations, give subjects opportunity to respond.

- Contact subjects in writing (email creates a record)
- Give reasonable time to respond (24-48 hours minimum, longer for complex issues)
- Include their response in your story, even if it's a denial
- Document all attempts to reach them

This isn't just ethical — it often improves your story. Subjects may provide context you missed.

#### 4. Source Protection

If someone trusts you with sensitive information:

- Never reveal sources without explicit consent
- Use encrypted communication (Signal, ProtonMail)
- Be careful about metadata that could identify sources
- Explain risks to sources before they share

A journalist who burns a source will never be trusted again.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="ethics-scenario-quiz"
  question="You discover a small budget irregularity (€5,000) in a local official's expense reports. The official is running for re-election. What's the MOST ethical approach?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Publish immediately — voters deserve to know before the election", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Contact the official for explanation, verify the irregularity's context, then decide if it's newsworthy", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Wait until after the election to avoid influencing voters", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Ignore it — €5,000 is too small to matter", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Proportionality and right of reply are key. First verify and get context — the 'irregularity' might have a legitimate explanation. The official deserves a chance to respond before publication. Whether to publish depends on what you find, not election timing (which would be suppression) or the amount alone."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Before investigating, run through the ethical compass: Is there genuine public interest? Is your scrutiny proportionate? Will you give right of reply? Can you protect sources? If you can't answer "yes" confidently to these questions, reconsider before proceeding.
