# The Investigative Advantage

## Concept Introduction

Most journalists stop at the press release. They report what officials say, quote the announcement, and move on. But budget documents tell a different story — they reveal what governments actually prioritize, not what they claim to prioritize.

Your competitive advantage as an investigative journalist is simple: **willingness to dig into documents others ignore.** Budget data is public, but underutilized. The gap between press releases and budget lines is where stories live.

> **Key Insight:** Politicians announce; budgets reveal. The gap between rhetoric and spending is where investigations begin.

## Core Explanation

### Principle 1: Follow the Money 💰

Every political promise has a budget implication. When a minister says "Education is our top priority," check the budget:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Allocation | Is education spending increasing year-over-year? |
| Execution | Is the allocated money actually being spent? |
| Comparison | How does per-pupil spending compare to EU averages? |

**The formula:** Political claim + Budget data = Verification or contradiction

### Principle 2: Think in Systems 🔍

A single overpriced contract could be a mistake. But when you find:
- The same supplier winning contracts across multiple ministries
- Similar pricing anomalies in the same budget category each year
- Patterns of year-end spending spikes

...you're not looking at isolated incidents. You're looking at potential systems.

### Principle 3: Assume Incompetence First 🤔

Before assuming corruption, consider:
- Poor planning and unrealistic budgets
- Bureaucratic delays and procurement failures
- Staff turnover and institutional knowledge loss
- Genuine complexity in large projects

This isn't naiveté — it's methodology. Investigate both explanations. Often, you'll find incompetence that enabled or masked corruption.

### Principle 4: Persistence Beats Talent 📊

The best investigative journalists aren't necessarily the smartest. They're the most persistent. They read the documents others skip. They compare this year's budget to last year's. They notice what's missing.

Budget data rewards patience.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="follow-money-quiz"
  question="A government announces '2 billion RON for hospital modernization.' What should an investigative journalist check FIRST?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Interview the Health Minister about the announcement", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Check if 2 billion is actually allocated in the budget, and last year's execution rate", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Visit hospitals to see current conditions", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Poll citizens about their healthcare satisfaction", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Following the money means verifying claims against actual budget data. Before doing anything else, check: (1) Is 2 billion actually allocated? (2) What was allocated last year and how much was actually spent? This gives you the factual foundation for any story."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Your investigative advantage is simple: read what others skip. Budget documents are public but underutilized. Apply the four principles — follow the money, think in systems, assume incompetence first, persist — and you'll find stories others miss.
