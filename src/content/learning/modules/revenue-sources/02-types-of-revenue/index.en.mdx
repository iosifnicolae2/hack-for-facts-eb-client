# Types of Public Revenue

## Concept Introduction

Now that you know how much you contribute through salary taxes, let's zoom out and see the full picture. Where does ALL the government's money come from?

Romania collects approximately **34% of GDP** as public revenue each year. This comes from three main streams: taxes (like VAT and income tax), social contributions (like CAS and CASS), and other sources (including EU funds).

> **Key Insight:** VAT (Value Added Tax) is actually the largest single source of revenue — you pay it every time you buy something, and the government collects nearly as much from VAT as from all salary-related taxes combined.

## Core Explanation: Revenue Categories

Let's break down the three main sources of public revenue:

### 1. Taxes (~50% of revenue)

<ResponsiveTable>
| Tax Type | Rate | Who Pays | Example |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| **VAT** | 21% standard | Everyone (consumers) | Buy a phone for 1,210 RON = 210 RON VAT |
| **Income Tax** | 10% flat | Employees | Salary of 5,000 RON = 325 RON tax |
| **Corporate Tax** | 16% | Companies | Profit of 1M RON = 160,000 RON tax |
| **Excise Duties** | Varies | Consumers | Fuel, alcohol, tobacco |
</ResponsiveTable>

> **VAT has reduced rates too:** 11% applies to food, tourism, books, medicines, and hotels. A 9% transitional rate applies until July 2026 for qualifying new housing (under 120 m², valued below RON 600,000, with pre-contracts signed by August 1, 2025).

### 2. Social Contributions (~34% of revenue)

These fund specific social programs:

- **CAS (25%)** — Public pension fund
- **CASS (10%)** — Public health insurance
- **CAM (2.25%)** — Work accident and disease insurance

### 3. Other Sources (~16% of revenue)

- **EU Funds** — Structural, Cohesion, Recovery (PNRR)
- **Dividends** — From state-owned companies
- **Fees & Fines** — Administrative fees, court fines
- **Public Debt** — Borrowing (technically not revenue, but covers shortfall)

VAT is often "invisible" because it's included in prices. Let's make it visible.

## Key Takeaway

> **Remember:** Public revenue comes from three main sources: taxes (~50%, with VAT being the largest), social contributions (~34%, like CAS and CASS), and other sources (~16%, including EU funds). Every time you buy something, you're paying VAT at 21% (or 11% for food and books) — often more than you realize.
