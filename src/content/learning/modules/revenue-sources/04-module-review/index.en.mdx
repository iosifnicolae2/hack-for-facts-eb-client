## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="revenues-review-q1"
  question="If you earn 10,000 RON gross salary, approximately how much goes to public budgets through your direct contributions?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "About 1,000 RON (10%)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "About 2,500 RON (25%)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "About 4,150 RON (41.5%)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "About 6,000 RON (60%)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Your 10,000 RON gross salary contributes: 1,000 RON income tax (10%), 2,500 RON CAS (25%), 1,000 RON CASS (10%) = 4,500 RON directly. Plus your employer pays additional contributions. The total tax wedge is approximately 41.5% of gross."

<Quiz
  id="revenues-review-q2"
  question="Romania's tax-to-GDP ratio is about 28-29%. How does this compare to the EU average?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "It's about average for the EU", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It's about 11-12 percentage points below the EU average (~40%)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "It's higher than most EU countries", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "It's the highest in the EU", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Romania's tax-to-GDP ratio of ~28-29% (2024) is the second-lowest in the EU after Ireland, where the average is ~40%. This 'revenue gap' of about 11-12 percentage points limits what the government can spend on public services without running deficits."

<Quiz
  id="revenues-review-q3"
  question="What is the main reason for Romania's low tax collection compared to other EU countries?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Tax rates are much lower than in other countries", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The country has a smaller economy", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "High levels of tax evasion and informal economy", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Romania doesn't have income taxes", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Romania's tax rates are actually comparable to many EU countries. The gap comes from collection efficiency: a large informal economy, VAT fraud (VAT gap of ~30%), and difficulty taxing self-employed and agricultural workers. This is why closing the 'revenue gap' is a policy priority."

<Quiz
  id="revenues-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Foundations) What is the largest category of public spending that these revenues must fund?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Healthcare", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Social Protection (pensions)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Defense", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Social Protection, primarily pensions for ~4.7 million retirees, is the largest spending category (~32% of budget). This creates pressure on revenues: when collection is low but pension obligations are fixed, something else must give—often capital investments."
