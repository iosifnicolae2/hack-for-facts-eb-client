# Your Tax Contribution

## Concept Introduction

Every time you receive a salary, a significant portion goes to the state before you ever see it. But how much exactly? Most people know about the 10% income tax, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

The real surprise comes when you add up all the contributions. Between what's deducted from your paycheck and what your employer pays on your behalf, **approximately 43% of your total labor cost goes to the state**.

> **Key Insight:** When someone says "I pay 10% tax," they're only counting income tax. The full picture includes pension contributions (CAS), health insurance (CASS), and employer contributions — totaling far more than most realize.

**Component Interface:**

```typescript
/**
 * SalaryCalculator Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Allow users to calculate their tax contribution from gross salary
 */
interface SalaryCalculatorProps {
  readonly initialValue?: number
  readonly currency?: 'RON' | 'EUR'
  readonly onCalculate?: (result: SalaryCalculationResult) => void
}

interface TaxRate {
  readonly id: 'cas' | 'cass' | 'income_tax' | 'cam'

/**
 * TAX RATES (as of 2025):
 * - CAS (Contributia de Asigurari Sociale): 25% - employee
 * - CASS (Contributia de Asigurari Sociale de Sanatate): 10% - employee
 * - Income Tax: 10% of (gross - CAS - CASS) - employee
 * - CAM (Contributia Asiguratorie pentru Munca): 2.25% - employer
 *
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - inputValue: number (user's entered salary)
 * - isCalculating: boolean (brief loading state for animation)
 * - result: SalaryCalculationResult | null
 * - error: string | null (validation errors)
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - User types -> update inputValue, clear error, debounce calculation
 * - User submits (Enter) -> immediate calculation
 * - Invalid input (< 0 or NaN) -> set error message
 * - Valid input -> compute result, animate breakdown
 *
 * CALCULATION LOGIC:
 * 1. CAS = gross * 0.25
 * 2. CASS = gross * 0.10
 * 3. Taxable income = gross - CAS - CASS
 * 4. Income tax = taxable income * 0.10
 * 5. Net salary = gross - CAS - CASS - income tax
 * 6. CAM = gross * 0.0225 (employer pays)
 * 7. Total employer cost = gross + CAM
 * 8. Total to state = CAS + CASS + income tax + CAM
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Input field: type salary amount, supports numeral formatting
 * - Enter key: trigger immediate calculation
 * - Clear button: reset to initial state
 * - Click on breakdown item: show tooltip with explanation
 * - Hover breakdown bar: highlight and show exact percentage
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Empty: placeholder text "Enter your gross salary in RON"
 * - Filled: show formatted number with RON suffix
 * - Calculating: brief pulse animation (200ms)
 * - Result: animated breakdown bars fill from 0% to calculated %
 * - Error: red border, shake animation (300ms), error text below
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Result bars: stagger animation, 100ms delay between each
 * - Number counters: count-up animation over 500ms using ease-out
 * - Entry: fade-in + slide-up (200ms, ease-out)
 * - Error shake: translateX oscillation (0 -> 10px -> -10px -> 0)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="application" on calculator container
 * - aria-live="polite" on result region
 * - Input has aria-describedby linking to format hint
 * - aria-label on each breakdown bar with amount and percentage
 * - Each breakdown item is a list item for screen readers
 * - Keyboard navigable: Tab through input, bars, and clear button
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Real-time calculation as user types (debounced 300ms)
- Animated pie chart showing net vs. deductions
- Breakdown bars animate sequentially with stagger effect
- Annual contribution calculated as monthly × 12
- Comparison tooltip: "This could buy X months of groceries"

## Core Explanation: The Full Tax Picture

When you see your payslip, you're only seeing part of the story. Here's the complete breakdown of what happens to a typical 5,000 RON gross salary:

### Employee Deductions (From Your Paycheck)

| Contribution | Rate | Amount | Purpose |
|--------------|------|--------|---------|
| **CAS** (Pension) | 25% | 1,250 RON | Public pension fund |
| **CASS** (Health) | 10% | 500 RON | Public health insurance |
| **Income Tax** | 10%* | 325 RON | General state budget |
| **Total Deducted** | | **2,075 RON** | |

*Income tax is calculated on the amount after CAS and CASS deductions.

### Employer Contribution (Hidden Cost)

| Contribution | Rate | Amount | Purpose |
|--------------|------|--------|---------|
| **CAM** (Work Insurance) | 2.25% | 113 RON | Work accident insurance |

### The Bottom Line

```
Gross Salary:         5,000 RON
Your Net Salary:      2,925 RON  (58.5% of gross)
Total to State:       2,188 RON  (43% of employer cost)
```

> **Important:** Your employer actually spends 5,113 RON to pay you 2,925 RON net. The difference — nearly half — goes to the state in various forms.

<Quiz
  id="revenue-sources-01-q1"
  question="What percentage of your gross salary goes to CAS (pension contribution)?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "10%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "16%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "25%", isCorrect: true },

## Key Takeaway

> **Remember:** When you earn a gross salary, approximately 43% of the total labor cost goes to the state — not just the 10% income tax you might think about. Your payslip shows CAS (25%), CASS (10%), and income tax (10%), plus your employer pays an additional 2.25% CAM on top.
