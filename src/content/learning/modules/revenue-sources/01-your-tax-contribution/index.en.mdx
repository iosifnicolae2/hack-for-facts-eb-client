# Your Tax Contribution

## Concept Introduction

Every time you receive a salary, a significant portion goes to the state before you ever see it. But how much exactly? Most people know about the 10% income tax, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

The real surprise comes when you add up all the contributions. Between what's deducted from your paycheck and what your employer pays on your behalf, **approximately 43% of your total labor cost goes to the state**.

> **Key Insight:** When someone says "I pay 10% tax," they're only counting income tax. The full picture includes pension contributions (CAS), health insurance (CASS), and employer contributions — totaling far more than most realize.

## Core Explanation: The Full Tax Picture

When you see your payslip, you're only seeing part of the story. Here's the complete breakdown of what happens to a typical 5,000 RON gross salary:

### Employee Deductions (From Your Paycheck)

| Contribution | Rate | Amount | Purpose |
|--------------|------|--------|---------|
| **CAS** (Pension) | 25% | 1,250 RON | Public pension fund |
| **CASS** (Health) | 10% | 500 RON | Public health insurance |
| **Income Tax** | 10%* | 325 RON | General state budget |
| **Total Deducted** | | **2,075 RON** | |

*Income tax is calculated on the amount after CAS and CASS deductions.

### Employer Contribution (Hidden Cost)

| Contribution | Rate | Amount | Purpose |
|--------------|------|--------|---------|
| **CAM** (Work Insurance) | 2.25% | 113 RON | Work accident insurance |

### The Bottom Line

```
Gross Salary:         5,000 RON
Your Net Salary:      2,925 RON  (58.5% of gross)
Total to State:       2,188 RON  (43% of employer cost)
```

> **Important:** Your employer actually spends 5,113 RON to pay you 2,925 RON net. The difference — nearly half — goes to the state in various forms.

## Key Takeaway

> **Remember:** When you earn a gross salary, approximately 43% of the total labor cost goes to the state — not just the 10% income tax you might think about. Your payslip shows CAS (25%), CASS (10%), and income tax (10%), plus your employer pays an additional 2.25% CAM on top.
