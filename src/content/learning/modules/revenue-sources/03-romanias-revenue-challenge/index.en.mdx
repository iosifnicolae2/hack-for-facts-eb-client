# Romania's Revenue Challenge

## Concept Introduction

You've learned about your personal tax contribution and the types of public revenue. Now let's face a difficult truth: Romania collects the **lowest revenue as a percentage of GDP in the entire European Union** — yet spends close to the EU average.

The math is simple: when you collect 34% but spend 43.5%, you get a deficit. And at 9.3% of GDP, Romania's deficit is one of the highest in Europe. This isn't just an abstract number — it affects interest rates, inflation, and future taxes.

> **Key Insight:** Romania's problem isn't just about spending too much — it's fundamentally about collecting too little. Fixing this requires either higher taxes, better enforcement, or both.

## Interactive Element: EU Comparison Chart

See how Romania compares to other EU countries in terms of revenue collection.

**Component Interface:**

```typescript
/**
 * EUComparisonChart Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Visualize Romania's position compared to EU countries on revenue metrics
 */
interface EUComparisonChartProps {
  readonly title: string
  readonly items: readonly ComparisonItem[]
  readonly unit?: string
  readonly highlightItem?: string
  readonly showAverage?: boolean
  readonly averageLabel?: string
  readonly annotations?: readonly {
    readonly itemId: string
    readonly text: string
    readonly position: 'left' | 'right'
  }[]
  readonly onItemClick?: (itemId: string) => void
}

interface ComparisonItem {
  readonly id: string
  readonly label: string
  readonly value: number
  readonly flag?: string
  readonly isHighlighted?: boolean
  readonly metadata?: Record<string, string | number>
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - hoveredItem: string | null
 * - sortedItems: ComparisonItem[] (computed, sorted by value)
 * - maxValue: number (for scaling bars, typically max item + 10%)
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Hover bar -> set hoveredItem, show tooltip with exact value
 * - Click bar -> trigger onItemClick callback (for drill-down)
 * - Mouse leave -> clear hoveredItem
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Hover bar: show exact value in tooltip
 * - Click bar: optional drill-down to country details
 * - Keyboard: arrow keys navigate between bars
 * - Enter on focused bar: trigger click action
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: all bars in neutral color, highlighted item in accent
 * - Hovered: bar elevates slightly, shows value tooltip
 * - Average line: dashed vertical line if showAverage=true
 * - Highlighted: Romania bar uses warning/red color with annotation
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Entry: bars grow from left to right (600ms, staggered 50ms between)
 * - Hover: scale(1.02) on Y axis + shadow elevation (150ms)
 * - Average line: draws from top to bottom (400ms, after bars complete)
 * - Annotation: fade-in after bar animation (200ms delay)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="img" on container with aria-label describing the chart
 * - Each bar has role="listitem" with aria-label: "[Country]: [Value]%"
 * - Average line has aria-label: "EU Average: [Value]%"
 * - Screen reader announces "Romania: 34%, lowest in EU" for highlighted item
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Horizontal bars sorted by value (highest to lowest)
- Romania highlighted in distinct color with "← LOWEST" annotation
- EU Average shown as dashed vertical line
- Hover reveals exact percentage and country details

## Core Explanation: The Deficit Equation

Understanding Romania's budget challenge requires simple math:

```
     REVENUE        SPENDING         DEFICIT
       34%     -      43.5%     =     -9.3%
```

### Why Collection Is So Low

| Factor | Impact | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Informal Economy** | ~30% of GDP | Cash payments, unreported income |
| **VAT Gap** | ~35% uncollected | Highest VAT fraud rate in EU |
| **Weak Administration** | Low audit rate | ANAF understaffed, outdated systems |
| **Exemptions** | Reduce base | IT salary exemptions, micro-enterprise regime |

### The Consequences

1. **More borrowing** — Public debt growing rapidly
2. **Higher interest rates** — Investors demand premium for risk
3. **Inflation pressure** — Money printing to cover shortfall
4. **Future tax increases** — Like the VAT hike to 21%
5. **Reduced public services** — Less money for healthcare, education

> **The irony:** Romanians pay relatively high tax rates (43% of labor cost), but so much goes uncollected that the government still doesn't have enough money.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="revenue-sources-03-q1"
  question="Romania collects approximately what percentage of GDP in revenue?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "25%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "34%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "44%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "50%", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Romania collects approximately 34% of GDP as public revenue — the lowest in the entire European Union. The EU average is 44%."
/>

<Quiz
  id="revenue-sources-03-q2"
  question="What is the primary reason Romania has a budget deficit?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Government spending is the highest in Europe", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Revenue collection is too low compared to spending", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "The EU doesn't send enough funds", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "All government workers are overpaid", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Romania's deficit exists because it collects only 34% of GDP but spends about 43.5%. The spending level is close to EU average, but collection is the lowest — meaning the problem is primarily about collecting too little, not spending too much."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> **Remember:** Romania collects the LOWEST revenue in the EU (34% of GDP) but spends close to average (43.5%). This creates a 9.3% deficit — meaning future generations will pay through higher taxes, inflation, or reduced services. The solution requires better tax collection, not just higher rates.
