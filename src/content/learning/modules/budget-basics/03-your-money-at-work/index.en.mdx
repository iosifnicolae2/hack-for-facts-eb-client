# From Paycheck to Services

Every paycheck, about 41% of your gross salary goes to the government. But here's what most people get wrong about where it ends up...

They think bureaucracy dominates. They think politicians' salaries eat most of it. They're wrong. By the end of this lesson, you'll know exactly where your money flows—and the answer might surprise you.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:** Trace the flow of your taxes from paycheck to public services and calculate your approximate annual contribution.

## Quick Recall

<Hidden trigger="From Lesson 2: What is your 'beneficiary' role?">
As a beneficiary, you receive public services funded by the collective tax contributions. Most citizens receive more in services than they pay in taxes—that's how progressive taxation and public goods work.

Now let's see exactly what services your taxes fund—and whether you're getting a good deal.

## Where the Money Comes From

Every leu in the public budget comes from somewhere. Here are the main sources:

| Source | Share | What It Is |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Social Contributions** | ~35% | CAS (pension) and CASS (health) from salaries |
| **VAT** | ~25% | 21% added to most purchases |
| **Income Tax** | ~12% | 10% of taxable salary |
| **Other Taxes** | ~15% | Corporate tax, excise duties, property taxes |
| **EU Funds** | ~13% | Money from European Union programs |

### Let's Follow Maria's Salary

Maria earns 5,000 RON gross per month. Let's trace her contribution step by step:

**Step 1: Social contributions are deducted**
- Pension (CAS): 5,000 × 25% = **1,250 RON**
- Health (CASS): 5,000 × 10% = **500 RON**

**Step 2: Income tax is calculated**
- Taxable base: 5,000 - 1,750 = 3,250 RON
- Income tax: 3,250 × 10% = **325 RON**

**Step 3: Maria's total contribution**
- Monthly: 1,250 + 500 + 325 = **2,075 RON** (41.5% of gross)
- Annual: 2,075 × 12 = **24,900 RON**

<Hidden trigger="Calculate your own: If you earn 7,000 RON gross, what's your monthly contribution?">
- CAS: 7,000 × 25% = 1,750 RON
- CASS: 7,000 × 10% = 700 RON
- Taxable: 7,000 - 2,450 = 4,550 RON
- Income tax: 4,550 × 10% = 455 RON
- **Total: 2,905 RON/month** (41.5%)

> For every 10 lei you earn, about 4 lei go to public services.

## Where the Money Goes

Romania spends about **727 billion RON** per year (2024). Here's how it's divided:

| Category | Share | What It Covers |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Social Protection** | ~32% | Pensions, unemployment, welfare |
| **Economic Affairs** | ~16% | Transport, energy, agriculture |
| **Health** | ~12% | Hospitals, doctors, medicines |
| **General Services** | ~11% | Administration, debt payments |
| **Education** | ~8% | Schools, universities, teachers |
| **Public Order** | ~7% | Police, courts, prisons |
| **Defense** | ~4% | Military, NATO commitments |
| **Other** | ~10% | Housing, environment, culture |

### The Surprise

Most people think bureaucracy dominates spending. **Reality check:**

Social Protection (mainly pensions for ~4.7 million retirees) is the largest category—**bigger than Health and Education combined**.

<Hidden trigger="Why is Social Protection so large?">
Romania has about 4.7 million pensioners and a rapidly aging population. The average pension is ~2,800 RON/month. Multiply that by 12 months and 4.7 million people: that's over 150 billion RON annually just for pensions.

## The Gap Between Plans and Reality

Budgets are promises. Reality often differs.

**Execution rate** = How much was actually spent vs. how much was planned

| Rate | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 100% | Government spent exactly what was planned |
| 80% | 20% of planned spending didn't happen |
| 120% | Government overspent by 20% |

### Why Execution Gaps Matter

When a hospital's budget shows 70% execution, it might mean:
- Planned surgeries didn't happen
- Equipment wasn't purchased
- Staff wasn't hired
- Patients suffered

When a road project shows 40% execution, it might mean:
- Construction stalled
- Contractors weren't paid
- The road remains unfinished

> Understanding execution gaps is key to knowing whether promises become reality—and this is where your watchdog role becomes powerful.

## Check Your Understanding

<Quiz
  id="execution-gap-analysis"
  question="Ion's city planned 10 million RON for education and 8 million RON for healthcare. The education budget shows 90% execution, while healthcare shows 60% execution. As a watchdog citizen, what should Ion investigate first?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education, because it has the larger budget", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Healthcare, because a 40% execution gap suggests serious problems", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Neither—90% and 60% are both acceptable execution rates", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Both equally—any underspending is equally concerning", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Ion should investigate healthcare first. A 60% execution rate means 40% of planned healthcare spending (3.2 million RON) didn't happen—that's significant. Education at 90% execution means only 1 million RON was unspent, and some underspending is normal. The size of the gap matters more than the size of the budget. As a watchdog, Ion should ask: Why wasn't this healthcare money spent? What services were affected?"

## Key Takeaway

> Your taxes flow from your paycheck (about **41.5% of gross salary**) into public services. The largest category (~32%) is **Social Protection** (mainly pensions), followed by Economic Affairs, Health, and General Services. Understanding **execution rates** reveals whether budget promises become reality—and gives you the data to ask informed questions.

In the final lesson, you'll put all this knowledge into practice by exploring the Budget Explorer yourself. You'll find real numbers, real gaps, and real surprises.
