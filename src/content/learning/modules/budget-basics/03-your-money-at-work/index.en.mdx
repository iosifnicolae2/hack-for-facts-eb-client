# Your Money at Work

## Concept Introduction

Now that you understand what a public budget is and your three roles (taxpayer, beneficiary, watchdog), let's see the big picture: where does the money come from, and where does it go?

This quick overview connects the dots between your paycheck and the roads you drive on.

> **Key Insight:** About 43% of Romania's GDP flows through public budgets each year. That's money collected from citizens and businesses, then spent on everything from pensions to police.

## Where the Money Comes From

Every lei in the public budget comes from somewhere. Here are the main sources:

| Source | Share | What It Is |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Social Contributions** | ~35% | CAS (pension) and CASS (health) deducted from salaries |
| **VAT** | ~25% | 19% added to most purchases |
| **Income Tax** | ~12% | 10% of taxable salary |
| **Other Taxes** | ~15% | Corporate tax, excise duties, property taxes |
| **EU Funds** | ~13% | Money from European Union programs |

### Your Personal Contribution

For every 5,000 RON gross salary:
- **1,250 RON** goes to pension (CAS - 25%)
- **500 RON** goes to health insurance (CASS - 10%)
- **325 RON** goes to income tax (10% of remaining)
- **Total: ~2,075 RON** (about 41.5% of gross)

> You contribute roughly 4 lei out of every 10 you earn to public services.

## Where the Money Goes

Romania spends about **727 billion RON** per year (2024). Here's how it's divided:

| Category | Share | What It Covers |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Social Protection** | ~32% | Pensions, unemployment, welfare |
| **Economic Affairs** | ~16% | Transport, energy, agriculture |
| **Health** | ~12% | Hospitals, doctors, medicines |
| **General Services** | ~11% | Administration, debt payments |
| **Education** | ~8% | Schools, universities, teachers |
| **Public Order** | ~7% | Police, courts, prisons |
| **Defense** | ~4% | Military, NATO commitments |
| **Other** | ~10% | Housing, environment, culture |

### The Surprise

Most people think bureaucracy dominates spending. **Reality check:** Social Protection (mainly pensions for ~4.7 million retirees) is the largest category - bigger than Health and Education combined.

## The Gap Between Plans and Reality

Budgets are promises. Reality often differs.

**Execution rate** = How much was actually spent vs. how much was planned

- 100% execution = Government spent exactly what was planned
- 80% execution = 20% of planned spending didn't happen
- 120% execution = Government overspent by 20%

Why does this matter? When a hospital's budget shows 70% execution, it might mean:
- Planned surgeries didn't happen
- Equipment wasn't purchased
- Staff wasn't hired

> Understanding execution gaps is key to knowing whether promises become reality.

## Key Takeaway

> Your taxes flow from your paycheck (about 41.5% of gross salary) into public services. Most of that money (~32%) goes to Social Protection (mainly pensions), followed by Economic Affairs, Health, and Administration. Understanding this flow is the foundation for meaningful budget oversight.
