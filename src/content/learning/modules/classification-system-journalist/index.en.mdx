## The three-dimensional classification

| Dimension | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Organizational** | WHO spends? | Ministerul Educației → ISJ Sibiu → Liceul X |
| **Functional** | FOR WHAT purpose? | 65.02.04.01 = Secondary education |
| **Economic** | WHAT TYPE of spending? | 71.01.01 = Construction |

## Economic codes (what type of spending)

- **TITLU 10** — Personnel (salaries, bonuses)
- **TITLU 20** — Goods & Services (watch 20.30.30 - "Other expenses"!)
- **TITLU 71** — Capital Investments (Construction, Equipment)
- **TITLU 58** — EU-funded projects
