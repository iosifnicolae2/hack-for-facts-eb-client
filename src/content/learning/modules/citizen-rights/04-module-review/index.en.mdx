## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-review-q1"
  question="Under Law 544/2001, how long does a public institution have to respond to a standard information request?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "24 hours", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "10 working days", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "30 calendar days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "There is no deadline", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Standard requests: 10 working days. Complex requests (requiring research or compilation): 30 working days. If they don't respond, you can file a complaint. The deadline is your leverage as a citizen."
/>

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-review-q2"
  question="What makes a FOIA request more likely to get a useful response?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Asking for 'all budget information'", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Being specific about what data you need and citing relevant codes", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Writing a very long, detailed letter", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Sending it to multiple institutions simultaneously", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Specific requests get specific answers. 'Please provide execution data for code 65.02 + 71.01 for 2023-2024' is actionable. 'Tell me about education spending' invites a vague response. Use the classification codes you learned to target your request."
/>

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-review-q3"
  question="If you discover potential fraud or misuse of public funds, which institution should receive your report?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The Ministry of Education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "DNA (National Anticorruption Directorate) or Court of Accounts", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Only the local mayor's office", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "There is no way to report problems", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="For suspected corruption: DNA (dna.ro). For budget irregularities: Court of Accounts (curteadeconturi.ro). For procurement issues: CNSC. For integrity violations: ANI. Choose the right institution based on the type of problem you found."
/>

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Classification) Why should your FOIA request include specific budget classification codes?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "It's legally required", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It targets exactly the data you need, making evasive answers harder", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Institutions only understand classification codes", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Classification codes are optional decoration", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Specific codes = specific answers. Asking about 'code 65.02.04 + 71.03 execution for 2024' forces a precise response about secondary school repairs. General questions get general (often useless) answers. Your classification knowledge makes you a more effective watchdog."
