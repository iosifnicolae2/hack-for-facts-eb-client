# Your Legal Rights to Information

## Concept Introduction

You have more power than you think. Romanian law gives you real, enforceable rights to access public information and participate in government decisions. Most citizens don't know these rights exist—or how powerful they can be.

Two foundational laws protect your ability to monitor and engage with public budgets:

1. **Law 544/2001** — Free Access to Public Information
2. **Law 52/2003** — Public Participation in Decision-Making

> **Key Insight:** A well-crafted legal request is often more effective than social media complaints. The law is on your side—institutions are *required* to respond.

## Core Explanation

### Law 544/2001: Your Right to Know

This is Romania's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It gives you the legal right to request any document of public interest from any public institution.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Response Time** | 10 working days (standard) |
| **Extended Time** | 30 days for complex requests |
| **Refusal Deadline** | 5 days to communicate a refusal |
| **Media Requests** | 24 hours for verbal requests |
| **Cost** | Free (court appeals exempt from fees) |
| **Appeal** | Administrative or directly to court |
| **Liability** | Disciplinary action for officials |

**What you can request (explicitly covered by Art. 5):**
- Budget execution reports and financial statements
- Public contracts and procurement files
- Organizational charts
- Council decisions and normative acts

> **Note:** Salary grids and meeting minutes are not explicitly listed in Art. 5 and may face exceptions under Art. 12 (deliberations, personal data).

### Law 52/2003: Your Right to Participate

This law ensures you can participate *before* decisions are made, not just react afterward.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Advance Notice** | 30 working days before approval |
| **Comment Period** | Minimum 10 calendar days |
| **Draft Publication** | Website, HQ display, media, stakeholders |
| **Public Meetings** | Right to attend (3-day advance notice) |
| **Feedback Response** | Authority must justify rejected comments |

**When it applies:**
- Budget proposals and rectifications
- New local regulations
- Urban planning decisions
- Any decision affecting citizens

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-01-q1"
  question="Which law guarantees your right to request public documents?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Law 52/2003", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Law 544/2001", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Law 215/2001", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Law 188/1999", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Law 544/2001 (Free Access to Public Information) is Romania's FOIA law. It guarantees your right to request any document of public interest. Law 52/2003 is about participation in decision-making, not document access."
/>

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-01-q2"
  question="How many working days does an institution have to respond to a standard FOIA request?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "5 working days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "10 working days", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "30 working days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "60 working days", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Under Law 544/2001, institutions must respond within 10 working days for standard requests. Complex requests that require gathering information from multiple sources can take up to 30 days. This timeline is legally binding."
/>

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-01-q3"
  question="Under Law 52/2003, what is the minimum comment period for draft decisions?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "10 calendar days", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "b", text: "30 calendar days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "5 working days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "15 working days", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Law 52/2003 requires a minimum of 10 calendar days for public comments (Art. 7(4)). The 30 working days refers to the advance notice period between announcement and final approval—a separate requirement. Authorities must also justify why they rejected submitted feedback."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** You have two powerful legal tools—Law 544/2001 lets you request any public document (10-day response, appeals exempt from court fees), and Law 52/2003 gives you minimum 10 calendar days to comment on draft decisions. Courts consistently rule in favor of requesters—NGOs have won landmark cases establishing that you don't need to justify why you want information.
