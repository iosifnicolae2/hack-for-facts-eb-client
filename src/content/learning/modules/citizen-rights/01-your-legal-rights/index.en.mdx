# Your Legal Rights to Information

## Concept Introduction

You have more power than you think. Romanian law gives you real, enforceable rights to access public information and participate in government decisions. Most citizens don't know these rights exist—or how powerful they can be.

Two foundational laws protect your ability to monitor and engage with public budgets:

1. **Law 544/2001** — Free Access to Public Information
2. **Law 52/2003** — Public Participation in Decision-Making

> **Key Insight:** A well-crafted legal request is often more effective than social media complaints. The law is on your side—institutions are *required* to respond.

- Meeting minutes and council decisions

### Law 52/2003: Your Right to Participate

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-01-q1"
  question="Which law guarantees your right to request public documents?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Law 52/2003", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Law 544/2001", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Law 215/2001", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Law 188/1999", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Law 544/2001 (Free Access to Public Information) is Romania's FOIA law. It guarantees your right to request any document of public interest. Law 52/2003 is about participation in decision-making, not document access."
/>

<Quiz
  id="citizen-rights-01-q2"
  question="How many working days does an institution have to respond to a standard FOIA request?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "5 working days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "10 working days", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "30 working days", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "60 working days", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Under Law 544/2001, institutions must respond within 10 working days for standard requests. Complex requests that require gathering information from multiple sources can take up to 30 days. This timeline is legally binding."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** You have two powerful legal tools—Law 544/2001 lets you request any public document (10-day response), and Law 52/2003 ensures you can participate in government decisions before they're finalized. These aren't just suggestions—they're enforceable rights with penalties for non-compliance.
