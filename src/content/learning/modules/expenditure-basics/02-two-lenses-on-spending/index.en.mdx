# Two Lenses on Spending

## Concept Introduction

When you look at government spending, you can ask two very different questions:

1. **"What is the money FOR?"** → Education, Health, Defense, etc.
2. **"What TYPE of spending is it?"** → Salaries, Equipment, Buildings, etc.

These two questions give you two different views of the same money. Romania's budget uses both systems, and understanding the difference unlocks powerful insights.

> **Key Insight:** The same 10 million RON can be "Education spending" (functional) AND "Salary payments" (economic) at the same time. They're not competing categories — they're different lenses on the same reality.

## Core Explanation: The Two Classifications

### Functional Classification ("What for?")

Answers: **What purpose does this money serve?**

| Code | Category | Question it Answers |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 65 | Education | How much goes to schools? |
| 66 | Health | How much goes to hospitals? |
| 68 | Social Protection | How much goes to pensions? |
| 60 | Defense | How much goes to military? |

This is what most citizens think of when they think about "the budget." It tells you which sectors receive funding.

### Economic Classification ("What type?")

Answers: **What is the nature of the expense?**

| Code | Category | What it Includes |
|------|----------|------------------|
| 10 | Personnel | Salaries, bonuses, social contributions |
| 20 | Goods & Services | Utilities, supplies, maintenance, contracts |
| 51, 55, 57 | Transfers | Inter-governmental transfers, subsidies, social assistance |
| 71 | Capital Investments | Buildings, roads, equipment, vehicles |
| 30, 81 | Debt Service | Interest payments (30), loan repayments (81) |

This reveals how money is spent regardless of sector. It's crucial for understanding the structure of government spending.

### Why Both Matter

Consider this question: **"How much does Romania spend on teacher salaries?"**

To answer, you need BOTH classifications:
- **Functional:** Filter to Education (code 65)
- **Economic:** Filter to Personnel (code 10)
- **Result:** Education + Personnel = Teacher salaries

> **Pro Tip:** When investigating spending, always ask both questions. "Health spending increased" could mean more nurses (personnel) OR more medical equipment (investments). The economic breakdown tells you which.

> **Looking Ahead:** These classification codes are your investigation tools. In the [Classification Systems](/learning/local-budgets-guide/classification-systems) module, you'll learn to decode the full code hierarchy (like `65.02.04.01 + 71.01.01`), enabling you to drill down to exactly what you're looking for.

## Economic Classification Deep Dive

Here's Romania's spending by economic type (2024 data):

| Code | Type | Share | Key Insight |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 51, 55, 57 | Transfers | ~31% | Pensions, subsidies — relatively stable |
| 10 | Personnel | ~23% | Salaries must be paid — always high execution |
| 71 | Capital Investments | ~17% | Buildings, roads — **lowest execution rate** |
| 20 | Goods & Services | ~13% | Contracts, utilities — variable |
| 30, 81 | Debt Service | ~5% | Interest and repayments — must be paid |

> **🚨 Critical Pattern:** Code 71 (investments) is often budgeted but rarely fully spent. This is where infrastructure projects get delayed. Money is allocated for new schools and hospitals, but procurement issues, capacity constraints, and political factors mean it often doesn't get spent.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="expenditure-classification-code71"
  question="Economic code 71 (Active nefinanciare) refers to:"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Personnel costs (salaries and benefits)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Capital investments (buildings, roads, equipment)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Interest payments on government debt", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Transfers to citizens (pensions, subsidies)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 71 'Active nefinanciare' (non-financial assets) covers capital investments: buildings, roads, IT systems, vehicles, and equipment. This is the category with typically the LOWEST execution rates, meaning infrastructure money is often budgeted but not spent."
/>

<Quiz
  id="expenditure-classification-question"
  question="If you want to know how much Romania spends on hospital buildings, which classifications do you need?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Functional only (Health)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Economic only (Capital investments)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Both Functional (Health) AND Economic (Capital investments)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Neither — this data isn't available", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="To find hospital building spending, you need both lenses: Functional classification (Health, code 66) tells you it's for the health sector, and Economic classification (Capital investments, code 71) tells you it's for infrastructure. Cross-referencing both gives you the specific answer."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Functional = "What for?" (Education, Health, Defense). Economic = "What type?" (Salaries, Buildings, Transfers). Use both lenses together to get the full picture. Pay special attention to Code 71 — that's where infrastructure promises often go unfulfilled.
