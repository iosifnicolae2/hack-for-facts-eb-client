# Be the Finance Minister

## Concept Introduction

Now that you understand where money comes from (taxes, contributions, EU funds), let's see where it goes. Romania spends about **43.5% of GDP** through public budgets — that's over **727 billion RON** per year (2024).

But here's the thing: most of us have opinions about government spending without knowing the actual numbers. We think "too much goes to X" or "not enough to Y" — but how does our intuition compare to reality?

> **Key Insight:** The question isn't just HOW MUCH is spent, but also: Is it spent where you think it should be? And does actual spending match your priorities?

## Core Explanation: Romania's Spending Priorities

Here's where Romania's money actually goes:

| Rank | Category | % of Total | What it Covers |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Social Protection | ~31-32% | Pensions, unemployment, welfare |
| 2 | Economic Affairs | ~15-17% | Transport, energy, agriculture, industry |
| 3 | General Public Services | ~11-12% | Administration, debt servicing, EU contributions |
| 4 | Health | ~11-12% | Hospitals, doctors, medicines |
| 5 | Education | ~8-9% | Schools, universities, teachers |
| 6 | Public Order | ~6-7% | Police, courts, prisons |
| 7 | Defense | ~4% | Military, NATO commitments |
| 8 | Other | ~5-7% | Housing, environment, culture |

### The Social Protection Giant

**Why is Social Protection so large?** One word: pensions.

Romania has an aging population and a pay-as-you-go pension system. Current workers' contributions pay for current retirees. With fewer workers and more retirees, this category keeps growing.

- ~4.7 million pensioners (December 2024)
- Average pension: ~2,748 RON/month (post-September 2024 reform)
- This single expense is larger than Health + Education combined

> **Reality Check:** Many Romanians think too much goes to "bureaucrats" or "politicians." In reality, Social Protection (mostly pensions) dominates the budget. The actual administration costs are a small fraction.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="expenditure-largest-category"
  question="What is Romania's largest spending category?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education (schools and universities)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Health (hospitals and doctors)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Social Protection (pensions and welfare)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Defense (military and NATO)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Social Protection accounts for approximately 31-32% of Romania's budget, making it by far the largest category. This is primarily driven by pension payments to approximately 4.7 million pensioners. Health and Education combined are smaller than Social Protection alone."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Social Protection (mainly pensions) is Romania's #1 expense at ~31-32% of the budget. Before criticizing "wasteful spending," it helps to know where the money actually goes — and most of it goes to grandparents.
