# Be the Finance Minister

## Concept Introduction

Now that you understand where money comes from (taxes, contributions, EU funds), let's see where it goes. Romania spends about **43.5% of GDP** through public budgets — that's over **600 billion RON** per year.

But here's the thing: most of us have opinions about government spending without knowing the actual numbers. We think "too much goes to X" or "not enough to Y" — but how does our intuition compare to reality?

> **Key Insight:** The question isn't just HOW MUCH is spent, but also: Is it spent where you think it should be? And does actual spending match your priorities?

## Interactive Element: Budget Allocator Game

You're the Finance Minister for a day. You have 100 billion RON to allocate across spending categories. Make your choices, then see how they compare to Romania's actual budget.

### Component Specification

```typescript
/**
 * BudgetAllocatorGame Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Let users allocate a hypothetical budget, then compare
 * their choices against Romania's actual spending breakdown.
 */
interface BudgetAllocatorGameProps {
  readonly totalBudget: number // e.g., 100 (billions)
  readonly currency: 'RON' | 'EUR'
  readonly categories: readonly BudgetCategory[]
  readonly actualData: readonly ActualSpending[]
  readonly onCompare?: (result: ComparisonResult) => void
}

interface BudgetCategory {
  readonly id: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly icon: string
  readonly minValue: number
  readonly maxValue: number
  readonly defaultValue: number
  readonly description: string
}

interface ActualSpending {
  readonly categoryId: string
  readonly percentage: number
  readonly year: number
}

interface ComparisonResult {
  readonly allocations: readonly {
    categoryId: string
    userValue: number
    actualValue: number
    difference: number
  }[]
  readonly insights: readonly string[]
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - allocations: Record<categoryId, number> - user's current allocation
 * - isComparing: boolean - comparison mode active
 * - hasCompared: boolean - user has seen comparison at least once
 * - validationError: string | null - if total doesn't equal 100
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Slider drag → update allocations, recalculate total
 * - Total !== 100 → show validation message
 * - Click Compare → animate transition to comparison view
 * - Reset button → restore default values
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Drag slider: adjust allocation (5% increments for mobile-friendly)
 * - Direct input: type exact number (validates 0-100 range)
 * - Compare button: reveal actual values with animation
 * - Reset button: clear to defaults
 * - Category hover: show description tooltip
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: sliders at default positions, no comparison
 * - Invalid: total bar shows red if !== 100
 * - Comparing: split view showing user vs actual bars
 * - Match highlight: green glow on categories where user ≈ actual (±3%)
 * - Difference badges: show +X% or -X% with color coding
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Slider movement: smooth 150ms transition
 * - Compare reveal: staggered bar growth (100ms delay per category)
 * - Difference badges: pop-in animation (200ms, scale from 0.8)
 * - Total validation: shake on invalid (300ms)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - Sliders use role="slider" with aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, aria-valuenow
 * - aria-live="polite" on total and validation messages
 * - Keyboard: Arrow keys adjust by 1%, Page Up/Down by 5%
 * - Screen reader announces comparison results
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- Sliders must sum to exactly 100%
- Real-time total calculation as user adjusts
- Compare button reveals Romania's actual allocation
- Color-coded differences show where user's priorities differ
- Insights generated based on patterns (e.g., "Most people allocate more to Education than the government does")

## Core Explanation: Romania's Spending Priorities

Here's where Romania's money actually goes:

| Rank | Category | % of Total | What it Covers |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Social Protection | ~35% | Pensions, unemployment, welfare |
| 2 | Health | ~18% | Hospitals, doctors, medicines |
| 3 | Education | ~12% | Schools, universities, teachers |
| 4 | Economic Affairs | ~10% | Agriculture, transport, industry |
| 5 | Public Order | ~8% | Police, courts, prisons |
| 6 | Defense | ~6% | Military, NATO commitments |
| 7 | Other | ~11% | Housing, environment, culture |

### The Social Protection Giant

**Why is Social Protection so large?** One word: pensions.

Romania has an aging population and a pay-as-you-go pension system. Current workers' contributions pay for current retirees. With fewer workers and more retirees, this category keeps growing.

- ~9 million pensioners
- Average pension: ~2,000 RON/month
- This single expense is larger than Health + Education combined

> **Reality Check:** Many Romanians think too much goes to "bureaucrats" or "politicians." In reality, Social Protection (mostly pensions) dominates the budget. The actual administration costs are a small fraction.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="expenditure-largest-category"
  question="What is Romania's largest spending category?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education (schools and universities)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Health (hospitals and doctors)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Social Protection (pensions and welfare)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Defense (military and NATO)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Social Protection accounts for approximately 35% of Romania's budget, making it by far the largest category. This is primarily driven by pension payments to roughly 9 million retirees. Health and Education combined are smaller than Social Protection alone."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Social Protection (mainly pensions) is Romania's #1 expense at ~35% of the budget. Before criticizing "wasteful spending," it helps to know where the money actually goes — and most of it goes to grandparents.
