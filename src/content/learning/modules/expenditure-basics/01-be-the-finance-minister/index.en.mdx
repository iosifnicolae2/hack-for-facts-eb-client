# Be the Finance Minister

## Concept Introduction

Now that you understand where money comes from (taxes, contributions, EU funds), let's see where it goes. Romania spends about **43.5% of GDP** through public budgets — that's over **727 billion RON** per year (2024).

But here's the thing: most of us have opinions about government spending without knowing the actual numbers. We think "too much goes to X" or "not enough to Y" — but how does our intuition compare to reality?

> **Key Insight:** The question isn't just HOW MUCH is spent, but also: Is it spent where you think it should be? And does actual spending match your priorities?

## Core Explanation: Romania's Spending Priorities (COFOG 2024)

Here's where Romania's money actually goes:

| Rank | Category | % of Total | What it Covers |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Social Protection | ~29-30% | Pensions (4.7M recipients), child allowances, unemployment, social assistance |
| 2 | Economic Affairs | ~16-17% | Transport (A7, railways), energy, agriculture, industry support |
| 3 | General Public Services | ~12-14% | Administration, **2.1% GDP for interest payments**, EU contributions |
| 4 | Health | ~10-11% | Hospitals (7.28 beds/1,000), doctors, medicines |
| 5 | Education | ~8-9% | Schools, universities, teacher salaries |
| 6 | Public Order | ~6-7% | Police, courts, prisons (116% capacity) |
| 7 | Defense | ~5% | Military, NATO commitments (2.26% GDP achieved) |
| 8 | Other | ~9-10% | Environment (1.9% GDP), housing, culture, recreation |

### The Social Protection Giant

**Why is Social Protection so large?** One word: pensions.

Romania has an aging population and a pay-as-you-go pension system. Current workers' contributions pay for current retirees. With only **1.27 workers per pensioner** (8 pensioners for every 10 employees), this category keeps growing.

- **4,703,349 pensioners** (December 2024)
- Average pension: **2,748 RON/month** (post-September 2024 reform)
- 82.56% received increases averaging **+622 RON/month** (+27%)
- This single expense is larger than Health + Education combined
- Regional disparity: București has 4 pensioners per 10 workers, while Teleorman has **14-15 pensioners per 10 workers**

> **Reality Check:** Many Romanians think too much goes to "bureaucrats" or "politicians." In reality, Social Protection (mostly pensions) dominates the budget. Interest payments on debt (2.1% of GDP) are also substantial — a consequence of Romania's **9.3% deficit** (the worst in the EU).

  question="What is Romania's largest spending category?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education (schools and universities)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Health (hospitals and doctors)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Social Protection (pensions and welfare)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Defense (military and NATO)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Social Protection accounts for approximately 29-30% of Romania's budget (12.7% of GDP), making it by far the largest category. This is primarily driven by pension payments to 4,703,349 pensioners (December 2024). The 2024 pension reform increased average pensions by 27% (+622 RON/month). Health and Education combined are smaller than Social Protection alone."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Social Protection (mainly pensions) is Romania's #1 expense at ~29-30% of the budget. With 4.7 million pensioners and only 1.27 workers per retiree, this spending is structurally locked in. Before criticizing "wasteful spending," know that most of it goes to grandparents — and cutting it risks a 2024-style pension crisis.
