# The Execution Gap

## Concept Introduction

Governments love to announce big budgets: "We're allocating 10 billion for education!" But here's the question they hope you don't ask: **How much of that money was actually spent?**

The gap between planned budget and actual spending is measured by the **execution rate**. This simple metric reveals more about real priorities than any press release ever could.

> **Key Insight:** Always check execution rates, not just allocations. A ministry can claim a "record budget" while actually spending less than the year before. The execution rate tells the truth.

## Interactive Element: Execution Rate Comparison

See how different types of spending execute very differently.

> **Note:** The percentages below are typical patterns observed in Romanian budgets. The Ministry of Finance publishes spending in absolute values (billion lei), not as execution percentages. These estimates are based on comparing planned vs. actual spending data.

## Core Explanation: Why the Gap Matters

### The Execution Rate Formula

```
Execution Rate = (Actually Spent ÷ Planned Budget) × 100%
```

**Example:**
- Planned: 100 billion RON for Education
- Spent: 85 billion RON
- Execution Rate: 85%

### What Different Rates Mean

| Rate | Status | What it Signals |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| >95% | 🟢 Excellent | Money spent as planned |
| 80-94% | 🟡 Good | Minor underspending, possibly savings |
| 60-79% | 🟠 Concerning | Significant gap — investigate why |
| Below 60% | 🔴 Poor | Major failure — promises not kept |

### The Pattern That Repeats Every Year

One pattern is remarkably consistent in Romania:

| Spending Type | Typical Execution | Why? |
|---------------|-------------------|------|
| Personnel (salaries) | ~95-100% | Must be paid — people expect their wages |
| Goods & Services | ~85-95% | Contracts signed, services rendered |
| Transfers & Other | ~80-90% | Social assistance, grants — mostly automatic |
| **Investments** | **50-70%** | Projects delayed, procurement stuck |

> **🔴 The Investment Problem:** This is where Romania's development gets stuck. Money is budgeted for schools, hospitals, and roads — but year after year, 30-50% of it goes unspent. The new hospital wing? Delayed. The road repair? Next year. The school renovation? Still waiting.

### Why Do Investments Execute So Poorly?

1. **Complex procurement** — Public tender rules take 6-12 months
2. **Weak project preparation** — Projects aren't "shovel-ready"
3. **Capacity constraints** — Not enough people to manage projects
4. **Political interference** — Priorities shift with elections
5. **EU fund conditions** — Complex requirements cause delays

## Romania in EU Context

How does Romania compare on spending? (Data: Eurostat 2024)

    title: "Key Insight",
    content: "Romania's spending (43.5% of GDP) is below EU average. The REAL problem is twofold: Romania collects too little revenue (34.1% of GDP) and the 9.4% gap creates the EU's highest deficit.",
    revenue: 34.1,
    spending: 43.5
  }}
/>

> **The Real Problem:** Romania faces a dual challenge. First, it collects too little — at 34.1% of GDP, revenue is among the lowest in the EU. Second, the 9.4% gap between revenue and spending creates the EU's highest deficit (9.3% in 2024). Romania isn't overspending; it's under-collecting.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="expenditure-execution-rate"
  question="What is a typical execution rate for capital investments (Code 71) in Romania?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "95-100% (almost fully spent)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "80-90% (mostly spent)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "50-70% (significant underspending)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "30-40% (severe underspending)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Capital investments (Code 71 - Active nefinanciare) typically execute at only 50-70% in Romania. This means 30-50% of money allocated for buildings, roads, and equipment goes unspent. Meanwhile, personnel costs execute at ~95-100%. This pattern explains why infrastructure projects are chronically delayed."

<Quiz
  id="expenditure-romania-problem"
  question="Romania's spending as % of GDP is below EU average. What is Romania's actual budget problem?"
  options={[

    { id: "d", text: "Romania spends too little on social programs", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Romania's spending (43.5% of GDP) is below the EU average (49%). The problem is revenue: Romania collects only 34% of GDP — among the lowest in the EU. This 9.3% gap creates the EU's highest budget deficit, not overspending."

## Module Summary

Congratulations! You've completed the Expenditures module. Here's what you learned:

| Topic | Key Takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| Spending Categories | Social Protection is #1 (~33%), mostly pensions |
| Classifications | Functional = "what for", Economic = "what type" |
| Code 71 | Investments have the lowest execution rates (50-70%) |
| Execution Rates | Always check actual spending, not just allocations |
| Romania vs EU | Dual problem: low revenue + poor investment execution |

---

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Always check execution rates, not just allocations. The consistent pattern — salaries at ~98%, investments at 50-70% — reveals where promises go unfulfilled. Romania faces a dual challenge: collecting too little revenue (creating the EU's highest deficit) and executing development projects poorly.
