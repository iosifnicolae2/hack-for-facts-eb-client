## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="expenditures-review-q1"
  question="What does the functional classification tell you about a budget line?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "What type of expense it is (salary, equipment, etc.)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "What government purpose it serves (education, health, etc.)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Which ministry controls the money", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "When the money will be spent", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Functional classification answers 'What is this money FOR?' — Education (65), Health (66), Defense (60), etc. It tells you the government purpose. Economic classification tells you the type of expense (salaries, equipment). Organizational tells you who controls it."

<Quiz
  id="expenditures-review-q2"
  question="Why do capital investments (Code 71) consistently show lower execution rates than personnel costs (Code 10)?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Investment projects are optional while salaries are mandatory", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "b", text: "There are legal limits on how much can be invested", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Investment budgets are always set too high", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Personnel costs are easier to track", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Salaries are legally mandatory—employees must be paid monthly. But construction projects can be delayed, replanned, or 'carried forward' to next year. This structural difference means investments are the first to be cut when budgets are tight or administrative capacity is weak."

<Quiz
  id="expenditures-review-q3"
  question="A municipality shows: Personnel 99%, Goods & Services 87%, Investments 48%. What story does this tell?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The municipality is efficiently saving money", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Operations continue normally but infrastructure development is stalled", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "All categories are performing well", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "The municipality has no investment needs", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is the classic pattern: high execution on mandatory/operational costs (salaries, supplies), but less than half of planned investments executed. Schools stay open, but the new wing doesn't get built. Roads are maintained, but the new road waits for 'next year.'"

<Quiz
  id="expenditures-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Revenues) Romania's low tax collection (~28-29% of GDP vs EU average ~40%) affects expenditure in what way?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "It has no effect on spending decisions", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It forces trade-offs, often cutting investments to fund mandatory costs", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "It means Romania can spend more than other countries", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "It only affects defense spending", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Limited revenue + fixed mandatory costs (pensions, salaries) = less room for discretionary spending like investments. When revenue falls short of plans, investments are typically cut first because they're the most flexible category. This is why revenue and expenditure are deeply connected."
