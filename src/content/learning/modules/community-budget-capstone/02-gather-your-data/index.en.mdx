# Gather Your Data

## Concept Introduction

With your entity identified, it's time to dig into the actual numbers. This lesson will guide you through collecting the key metrics you need for a meaningful analysis.

Think of this as your data collection worksheet. By the end, you'll have all the raw materials needed to identify red flags and formulate smart questions.

> **Key Insight:** Good analysis starts with good data. Take your time to find accurate numbers — they're the foundation of everything that follows.

**Data Integration:**
- Budget data: `GET /api/analytics/entity-budget/{cui}?year={year}`
- Economic breakdown: Uses classification codes from budget data

## Understanding the Key Metrics

### Execution Rate

**Formula:** Execution Rate = (Actual Spending ÷ Planned Spending) × 100

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Excellent planning and execution |
| 80-90% | Good, minor adjustments |
| 70-80% | Moderate gaps to investigate |
| Below 70% | Significant issues, investigate |

### Economic Categories Explained

| Code | Category | What It Covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 10 | Personnel | Salaries, benefits, bonuses for employees |
| 20 | Goods & Services | Supplies, utilities, contracted services |
| 71 | Investments | Capital projects: buildings, equipment, infrastructure |
| 50-59 | Transfers | Money sent to other entities or programs |

> **Why This Matters:** Personnel costs are "rigid" (hard to cut), while investments are "flexible" (easy to delay). When budgets are tight, investments often get sacrificed first.

---

## Functional Classification Basics

The top spending functions show your entity's priorities:

**Common functions at local level:**

| Function | What It Funds |
|----------|---------------|
| Education | Schools, kindergartens (local share) |
| General Administration | City hall operations, salaries |
| Streets & Transport | Road maintenance, public transport |
| Social Assistance | Aid programs, social services |
| Culture & Recreation | Libraries, parks, sports facilities |

**Look for patterns:**
- Is administration consuming too much?
- Are investments in infrastructure happening?
- How does education compare to administration?

## Data Quality Tips

1. **Use the most recent complete year** — Current year data is incomplete
2. **Check for rectifications** — Budgets often change mid-year
3. **Note the source** — "Initial" vs "Rectified" vs "Executed" budgets differ
4. **Watch for zeros** — Missing data is common; note it, don't assume zero spending

---

## What If Data Isn't Available?

Sometimes the platform won't have all the data you need. Here's what to do:

<ExpandableHint trigger="My entity isn't listed on the platform">

**Option 1: Search variations**
Try different spellings (Cluj vs Cluj-Napoca), include or exclude "Primăria" or "Oraș", or search by county.

**Option 2: Check if it's a commune**
Villages are part of communes. Search for the commune name instead.

**Option 3: It may be newly created**
Some entities were recently reorganized. Check if data exists under an older administrative name.

**Option 4: Use FOIA**
If the entity exists but isn't on the platform, file a FOIA request directly with the entity for their budget execution reports.

</ExpandableHint>

<ExpandableHint trigger="Data is missing for some years or categories">

**Partial data is still valuable.** Work with what you have:

1. **Analyze available years** — Trends across 2-3 years are better than one perfect year
2. **Note the gaps** — Document what's missing as part of your analysis
3. **File a FOIA request** — Request the specific missing data (e.g., "Please provide execution data for code 71 for 2022-2024")
4. **Check alternative sources** — Some data may be on mfinante.gov.ro or the entity's own website

</ExpandableHint>

<ExpandableHint trigger="Numbers don't seem to add up or look wrong">

**Data quality varies.** Before assuming corruption, consider:

1. **Rectifications** — Initial and final budgets differ; make sure you're comparing apples to apples
2. **Accounting changes** — Classification codes sometimes change between years
3. **Timing** — Mid-year data may be incomplete
4. **Reporting delays** — Some entities report late

**If data genuinely seems wrong:** File a FOIA request asking for clarification. Sometimes it's a data entry error; sometimes it reveals something worth investigating.

</ExpandableHint>

**Remember:** The skills you learned in the Citizen Rights module apply here. When the platform can't answer your question, Law 544/2001 is your backup tool. A well-crafted FOIA request using specific classification codes will get you the data you need.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="capstone-02-q1"
  question="If a local government planned 10 million RON in investments (Code 71) but only spent 6 million, what is the execution rate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "40%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "60%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "166%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "6%", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Execution rate = (Actual ÷ Planned) × 100 = (6 ÷ 10) × 100 = 60%. This is below the 70% threshold and would be flagged for investigation — why weren't the planned investments completed?"
/>

<Quiz
  id="capstone-02-q2"
  question="Which economic category is typically the most 'rigid' (hardest to cut)?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Investments (Code 71)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Goods and Services (Code 20)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Personnel (Code 10)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Transfers (Code 50-59)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Personnel costs are rigid because they involve employment contracts and legal obligations. You can't easily fire staff to balance a budget. This is why investments often get delayed instead — they're more flexible."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> You now have your data worksheet complete. You've collected the essential metrics: overall execution rate, spending by economic type, and top functional priorities. In the next lesson, you'll put this data to work — checking for red flags that reveal deeper issues.
