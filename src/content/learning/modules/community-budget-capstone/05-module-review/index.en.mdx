## Final Assessment

<Quiz
  id="capstone-review-q1"
  question="You find your city has 99% personnel execution but 38% investment execution. Which combination of actions is most effective?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Wait and see if next year is better", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Drill into investment sub-codes, identify which projects failed, file targeted FOIA", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Report immediately to DNA without investigation", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Assume the data is wrong", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The complete approach: (1) Identify the red flag (38% investment), (2) Use classification to drill down (which type of investment? which sectors?), (3) Formulate specific questions, (4) File a targeted FOIA request. Acting too quickly or waiting passively are both suboptimal."
/>

<Quiz
  id="capstone-review-q2"
  question="Your investigation reveals: Education (65.02) investment at 25%, but Health (66.02) investment at 72%. What does this pattern suggest?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "A systemic problem affecting all sectors equally", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "A sector-specific problem in Education that needs targeted investigation", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Health is overspending", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "The classification system is broken", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Different execution rates across sectors indicate sector-specific issues, not systemic ones. Education at 25% vs. Health at 72% means something specific is wrong with education investment projects—procurement delays? land issues? contractor problems? Focus your investigation there."
/>

<Quiz
  id="capstone-review-q3"
  question="You want to know why the new school construction didn't happen. Which FOIA request is most effective?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "'Please tell me about education spending in 2024'", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "'Provide all budget documents for the past 5 years'", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "'Please provide execution details for code 65.02.04 + 71.01.01 for 2024, including project-level breakdown and reasons for any underspending'", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "'Is corruption happening in school construction?'", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Specific codes + specific timeframe + specific ask = actionable response. 65.02.04 is secondary education, 71.01.01 is construction. Asking for project-level breakdown and reasons forces detailed answers. Vague or accusatory requests get vague or defensive responses."
/>

<Quiz
  id="capstone-review-q4"
  question="After filing a FOIA request, the institution doesn't respond within 10 days. What's your next step?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Give up - they're allowed to ignore requests", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "File an administrative complaint citing Law 544/2001 deadline violation", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Immediately contact the press", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Send the same request again and wait another 10 days", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Law 544/2001 gives you enforcement rights. After deadline expiration, file a complaint with the institution's leadership. If still ignored, escalate to the Prefect or court. The law has teeth—non-response is itself a violation that can be sanctioned."
/>

<Quiz
  id="capstone-review-q5"
  question="(Integration) Your city shows these patterns: Personnel 67%, Investment execution 45%, 3 budget rectifications that cut investments. Which earlier modules' concepts explain this?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Only the Red Flags module", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Expenditures (execution gap) + Budget Cycle (rectification patterns) + Red Flags (warning signs)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Only the Revenues module", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Only the Foundations module", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This scenario integrates multiple modules: Expenditures taught the execution gap between personnel and investment; Budget Cycle taught that rectifications reveal mid-year trade-offs; Red Flags taught the 60% personnel threshold. Your integrated knowledge sees the full picture."
/>

<Quiz
  id="capstone-review-q6"
  question="What is the most important mindset shift this learning path teaches?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Public budgets are too complex for citizens to understand", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Only experts can analyze government spending", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "It's YOUR money, you have the tools and rights to hold government accountable", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Budget problems always require professional auditors to solve", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The core message: Public budgets are YOUR money. You have three roles (taxpayer, beneficiary, watchdog), legal rights (Law 544/2001), analytical tools (classifications, red flags), and platforms (Transparenta.eu). Citizen oversight complements—not replaces—professional auditing."
