# Six Budget Principles

## Concept Introduction

Romania's public finance system is built on six foundational principles, legally mandated by Legea 500/2002 (the Public Finance Law). These aren't abstract ideals — they're legal requirements that govern every budget decision you make.

Violating these principles isn't just poor practice; it can trigger personal liability. Understanding them is essential for both compliance and excellence in public administration.

> **Key Insight:** The six principles aren't optional guidelines — they're legally mandated requirements. Every budget decision should be tested against them.

## Core Explanation

### The Six Principles in Practice

#### 1. Publicitate (Publicity) — Art. 9 📢

**Requirement:** Proactively disclose budget information to the public.

**Practical implication:** Budget approval decisions, execution reports, and major contracts must be published. Citizens have the right to request any budget information under Law 544/2001.

**Violation example:** Refusing to publish budget execution reports or claiming they're "internal documents."

#### 2. Unitate (Unity) — Art. 10 📦

**Requirement:** All revenues and expenses must be recorded in a single budget.

**Practical implication:** You cannot maintain separate "funds" or "accounts" outside the official budget. All money flows through one consolidated document.

**Violation example:** Keeping certain revenues (like donations or sponsorships) in a separate, unreported account.

#### 3. Universalitate (Universality) — Art. 8 ➕

**Requirement:** Record all transactions at their gross (full) amounts.

**Practical implication:** If you receive 100,000 RON and spend 80,000 on collection costs, you record 100,000 revenue AND 80,000 expense — not just 20,000 net.

**Violation example:** Recording only net amounts or "netting" revenues against related expenses.

#### 4. Anualitate (Annuality) — Art. 11 📅

**Requirement:** The budget is approved for one fiscal year (January 1 - December 31).

**Practical implication:** Commitments must be made within the budget year. Multi-year projects require special procedures. Funds don't automatically carry over.

**Violation example:** Committing funds in December for work that won't happen until the next year without proper multi-year authorization.

#### 5. Specializare (Specificity) — Art. 12 🎯

**Requirement:** Money can only be spent for the purposes specified in the budget classification.

**Practical implication:** If funds are allocated for "training" (economic code 20.13), you cannot use them for "office supplies" (20.01). Classification codes are legally binding.

**Violation example:** Using personnel budget (Chapter 10) to cover goods and services (Chapter 20) without proper transfer approval.

#### 6. Legalitate (Legality) — Art. 14(2) ⚖️

**Requirement:** Every payment must have a legal basis — a law, contract, or regulation that authorizes it.

**Practical implication:** Before approving any payment, you must be able to point to the specific legal provision that allows it. No legal basis = no payment.

**Violation example:** Paying bonuses without a regulation or collective agreement that authorizes them.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="principles-quiz"
  question="A department head wants to record a donation of office equipment without showing it in the budget ('it's not public money'). Which principle does this violate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Publicitate (Publicity) — because it's not disclosed", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Unitate (Unity) — because all revenues must be in one budget", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Specializare (Specificity) — because it's not classified", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "No principle is violated — donations are private", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This violates Unitate (Unity): ALL revenues, including in-kind donations, must be recorded in the official budget. There cannot be 'shadow' assets or parallel accounting. Once received by a public institution, it becomes public property and must be properly recorded."
/>

<Quiz
  id="legalitate-quiz"
  question="A colleague argues that since they have budget allocation for 'miscellaneous expenses,' they can use it for anything. Are they correct?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Yes — 'miscellaneous' is flexible by definition", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "No — even 'miscellaneous' has a specific classification code and defined eligible expenses", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Yes, but only with supervisor approval", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "It depends on the amount", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This violates Specializare (Specificity). Even 'miscellaneous' budget lines have specific classification codes with defined eligible expenses. The name doesn't create unlimited flexibility — the classification code determines what can be funded."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** The six principles are your legal framework: Publicitate (disclose), Unitate (one budget), Universalitate (gross recording), Anualitate (fiscal year), Specializare (classification matters), and Legalitate (legal basis required). Test every decision against them.
