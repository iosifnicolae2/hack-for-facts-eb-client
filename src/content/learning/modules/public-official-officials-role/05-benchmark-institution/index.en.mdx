# Benchmark Your Institution

## Concept Introduction

Everything you've learned about your role, liability, and principles comes together when you see how your institution appears to the public. Transparenta.eu makes budget data visible to citizens, journalists, and oversight bodies — including your data.

Understanding how others see your institution helps you anticipate questions, identify improvement areas, and demonstrate the transparency that builds public trust.

> **Key Insight:** Knowing how your institution appears publicly isn't vanity — it's strategic. Anticipate questions, prepare explanations, and use peer comparisons to drive improvement.

### Component Specification

```typescript
interface InstitutionFinderProps {
  readonly searchConfig: {
    placeholder: string
    browseOptions: string[]
    maxPeers: number
  }
  readonly metrics: ReadonlyArray<{
    id: string
    label: string
    format: 'percentage' | 'currency' | 'number'
    thresholds: { good: number; warning: number }
  }>
  readonly onInstitutionSelect: (cui: string) => void
  readonly onPeerCompare: (peerCuis: string[]) => void
}

interface InstitutionFinderState {
  selectedInstitution: string | null
  selectedPeers: string[]
  metricsData: Record<string, Record<string, number>>
  isLoading: boolean
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Search with autocomplete for institution names
- Browse by category for users who don't know exact name
- Upon selection: display key metrics with visual indicators
- Add up to 3 peer institutions for comparison
- Color-coded indicators: green (good), yellow (warning), red (concern)
- Insights generated based on comparison
- Link to full Entity Analytics for deeper analysis

**Accessibility:**
- Autocomplete follows ARIA combobox pattern
- Metrics announced with context ("Execution rate: 78%, moderate")
- Comparison table uses proper table semantics
- Focus management between steps

## Core Explanation

### Understanding Your Institution's Profile

When citizens, journalists, or oversight bodies look at your institution on Transparenta.eu, they see several key metrics:

| Metric | What It Shows | Questions It May Raise |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Execution Rate** | % of budget actually spent | Low: Why wasn't money spent? High (>100%): Where did extra come from? |
| **Personnel Share** | % of budget on salaries | High: Is staffing appropriate? Low: Are services understaffed? |
| **Capital Execution** | Investment completion | Low: Are projects delayed? What's blocking infrastructure? |
| **Year-over-Year Change** | Spending trends | Sudden changes: What's driving this? |

### Why Peer Comparison Matters

Looking at your institution in isolation tells you little. Comparing with similar institutions reveals:

- **Performance gaps:** Where are you behind peers?
- **Best practices:** What are high-performers doing differently?
- **Context:** Is low execution a local problem or systemic?
- **Questions to anticipate:** What will critics ask about?

### Preparing for Scrutiny

When a journalist or citizen examines your institution's data, they typically ask:

1. **Why is execution low/high?** — Have an explanation ready
2. **Why the high personnel costs?** — Explain staffing needs and controls
3. **Why are capital projects delayed?** — Document barriers (permits, procurement, weather)
4. **How do you compare to peers?** — Know your ranking and explain differences

Proactive preparation prevents defensive crisis management.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="benchmark-quiz"
  question="Your institution has 52% capital investment execution while peer institutions average 75%. A journalist asks why. What's the BEST response?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Capital investments are difficult everywhere", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Explain the specific barriers (permit delays, procurement challenges) with documentation, and describe corrective actions", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Redirect to total budget execution, which is higher", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Decline to comment pending internal review", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Transparency builds trust. The best response is specific, documented, and forward-looking: explain what happened (specific barriers), provide evidence (documentation), and describe what you're doing about it (corrective actions). Vague excuses or deflection erodes credibility."
/>

<Quiz
  id="metrics-quiz"
  question="Your institution's personnel costs are 75% of the budget, while similar institutions average 55%. Is this necessarily a problem?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Yes — it indicates waste and overstaffing", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "No — personnel-intensive services (healthcare, education) legitimately have high personnel costs", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Yes — you should immediately reduce staff", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "No — personnel costs are beyond your control", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="High personnel costs aren't automatically problematic — context matters. Hospitals, schools, and service-focused institutions legitimately have high personnel shares. The question is whether the proportion is appropriate for your institution type, not whether it matches a generic average."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Your institution's budget data is public. Use Transparenta.eu to see what citizens and journalists see. Compare with peers to identify gaps and best practices. Prepare explanations for anomalies before you're asked — proactive transparency builds trust.
