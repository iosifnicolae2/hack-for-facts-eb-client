# The Journalist's Mindset

Develop the investigative approach to public money.

## Core principles

| Principle | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Follow the money, not rhetoric** | Politicians announce; budgets reveal. The gap between press releases and budget lines is where stories live |
| **Think in systems** | One suspicious contract is a tip; patterns across institutions are investigations |
| **Assume incompetence first** | Most anomalies stem from poor planning, not theft — but incompetence can mask corruption |
| **Persistence + data = advantage** | Most journalists stop at the press release; budget documents are public but underutilized |

## Ethical framework

- **Public interest** — Justify every investigation
- **Proportionality** — Match scrutiny to significance
- **Right of reply** — Always give subjects opportunity to respond
- **Source protection** — Guard those who trust you with information

> Open the [Budget Explorer](/budget-explorer) and compare any ministry's *approved* budget vs. *executed* spending. The gap between planning and reality is often where stories begin.
