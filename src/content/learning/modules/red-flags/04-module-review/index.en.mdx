## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-review-q1"
  question="A municipality shows 42% investment execution. What category of red flag is this?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Minor concern - within normal range", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Significant gap - worth investigating", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Critical failure - requires immediate action", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Excellent performance", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The red flag thresholds: 70-95% = minor, 50-70% = significant gap, below 50% = major failure. At 42%, this municipality failed to deliver more than half of planned investments. It's significant and worth investigating, though not as critical as 20%."

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-review-q2"
  question="Personnel costs at 68% of operating budget is considered a red flag. Why?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Employees are paid too much", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It leaves little room for other priorities like investments and services", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "The budget is too small", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "68% is below the recommended threshold", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="When personnel costs crowd out other spending, the budget becomes inflexible. At 68%, after paying salaries, only 32% remains for goods, services, and investments. This makes it nearly impossible to fund new projects or respond to emergencies."

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-review-q3"
  question="A pattern shows: Year 1: 55% investment execution. Year 2: 48%. Year 3: 41%. What does this trend indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Improving financial management", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Declining administrative capacity or worsening budget pressure", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Normal year-to-year variation", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Investment needs are decreasing", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="A downward trend in investment execution (55% → 48% → 41%) signals a worsening problem, not a one-time issue. This could indicate growing personnel costs, weakening procurement capacity, or chronic underfunding. Trend analysis is more valuable than single-year data."

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Classification) To investigate a low investment red flag, what should you drill into?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Total revenue figures", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Sub-codes (71.01 vs 71.03) and functional breakdowns (which sectors affected)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Last year's budget only", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "National economic indicators", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Use your classification knowledge: Drill into 71.01 (new assets) vs 71.03 (repairs) to see what type of investment failed. Then check functional codes (Education 65, Health 66) to see which sectors are affected. This turns a vague red flag into specific questions."
