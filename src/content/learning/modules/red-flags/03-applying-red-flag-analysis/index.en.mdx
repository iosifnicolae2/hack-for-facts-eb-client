# Applying Red Flag Analysis

## Concept Introduction

You've learned to recognize the seven major red flags. Now it's time to apply that knowledge. In this lesson, you'll analyze a case study, understand Romania's broader fiscal challenges, and practice finding red flags in real data.

Understanding the macro context is essential because local budget problems often connect to national fiscal pressures. When the country runs a large deficit, the pressure flows down to local governments.

> **Key Insight:** Local red flags often reflect national fiscal stress. Understanding both levels makes you a more effective watchdog.

## Romania's Macro Red Flag: The Deficit

Before diving into local analysis, understand the national context. Romania runs the largest budget deficit in the EU — and this affects every public budget in the country.

### What the Deficit Means for You

The deficit must be closed. There are only three ways:

| Option | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Higher Taxes** | VAT increase to 21% (effective Aug 2025), possible income tax changes |
| **Reduced Services** | Cuts to programs, delayed investments, service degradation |
| **Inflation** | "Stealth tax" that erodes savings and purchasing power |

**Why this matters for budget oversight:** When money is tight, every lei matters more. Waste, inefficiency, and corruption become even more damaging. This is why budget oversight is crucial right now.

### Case Study Solution

**Investment execution rate:** (1.8 ÷ 5) × 100 = **36%** 🔴 (threshold: >70%)

**Personnel as % of budget:** (32 ÷ 45) × 100 = **71%** 🔴 (threshold: \<60%)

**Red flags identified:**
1. 🔴 **Extremely low investment execution (36%)** — Severely under threshold
2. 🔴 **Personnel crowding out (71%)** — Over threshold
3. 🔴 **Frequent rectifications (3)** — At warning threshold
4. 🟡 **High direct awards (38%)** — Over 25% threshold
5. 🟡 **Arrears present (0.5M)** — Any arrears is concerning

**Verdict: 5 red flags present — this warrants investigation.**

## Investigation Methodology: From Red Flag to Inquiry

Spotting red flags is just the beginning. Here's a structured approach to turn observations into actionable investigations.

### Step 1: Confirm the Pattern

Before investigating, verify you're seeing a real issue:

| Check | How | Why |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Multiple years** | Look at 3+ years of data | One bad year could be an anomaly |
| **Multiple indicators** | Check related red flags | Patterns are more convincing than isolated data points |
| **Compare peers** | Check 2-3 similar localities | Outliers from peers deserve more scrutiny |

> **Rule of thumb:** A single borderline value in one year is noise. The same pattern across multiple years and indicators is signal.

### Step 2: Drill Down with Classification Codes

Use your classification knowledge to get specific:

**If you find low investment execution (Code 71):**
- Which sub-codes are affected? (71.01 new assets vs 71.03 repairs)
- Which functional areas? (65 Education vs 84 Transport)
- Is it all investments or specific sectors?

**If you find high personnel costs (Code 10):**
- Which sub-codes dominate? (10.01 salaries vs 10.02 bonuses)
- Which functional units are top spenders?
- How does it compare to service delivery?

<ExpandableHint trigger="Example drill-down">

**Initial red flag:** Investment execution is 42%

**Drill-down findings:**
- Education (65) investment: 78% execution ✓
- Health (66) investment: 65% execution ⚠️
- Transport (84) investment: 22% execution 🔴

**Refined question:** "Why was transport infrastructure investment only 22% executed while education achieved 78%? What specific road or transit projects were delayed?"

</ExpandableHint>

### Step 3: Formulate Specific Questions

Transform red flags into precise, answerable questions:

**Bad question:** "Why is spending so low?"
**Good question:** "Please provide the execution report for Code 71.01.01 (construction) under functional code 65.02.04 (secondary education) for 2023-2024, including project-level breakdown and stated reasons for any underspending."

**Question formula:**
> "Please provide [specific data type] for [specific codes] during [specific period], including [specific breakdowns] and [specific explanations]."

### Step 4: Combine Multiple Red Flags

When you find multiple red flags, weave them into a coherent narrative:

**Example pattern:** Low investment + High personnel + Frequent rectifications

**Narrative interpretation:**
"Personnel costs appear to be crowding out investment capacity. The entity repeatedly rectifies its budget to shift money from capital projects to operating expenses, suggesting chronic planning issues or staffing decisions that leave no room for development."

**Combined inquiry:**
1. What drove the three rectifications this year?
2. In each rectification, what was cut vs. what was added?
3. Has staffing increased while investment decreased over the past 5 years?
4. What capital projects were sacrificed to cover personnel costs?

### Step 5: Choose Your Action Channel

Based on what you find, pick the right approach:

| Situation | Best Channel | Why |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **Need more data** | FOIA request (Law 544/2001) | Forces a written response within 10 days |
| **Want public discussion** | Council meeting question | Creates public record and may spark media interest |
| **Suspect wrongdoing** | Report to oversight body | DNA, Court of Accounts, or CNSC depending on issue |
| **Want to inform others** | Share with journalists/civic groups | Amplifies impact and may trigger professional investigation |

## Guided Activity: Hunt for Red Flags

Now apply your skills to real data. Follow these steps to analyze your local government:

### Step 1: Open Entity Analytics

Navigate to the Entity Analytics page on Transparenta.eu to access detailed budget data.

[Open Entity Analytics →](/entities)

### Step 2: Find Your Local Government

Search for your city, town, or commune. Open the detailed view to see budget breakdowns.

### Step 3: Check for Each Red Flag

Use this checklist to systematically review:

- [ ] **Investment execution rate (Code 71)** — Is it below 70%?
- [ ] **Personnel as % of total budget** — Is it above 60%?
- [ ] **Number of rectifications** — Are there 3 or more?
- [ ] **Year-over-year spending change** — Is it above 20%?
- [ ] **Look for arrears** — Any unpaid bills reported?

### Step 4: Record Your Findings

Document what you find:
- How many potential red flags did you identify?
- What questions would you ask based on the data?
- Are there patterns that concern you?

### Step 5: Compare with Neighbors

Context matters. Compare your locality with similar neighbors:
- Do they have the same issues?
- Or is your locality an outlier?
- What explains the differences?

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-03-q1"
  question="Romania's ~9% budget deficit means which of the following is most likely in the coming years?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The economy will grow faster", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Tax increases, service cuts, or inflation — or some combination", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Government will have more money to spend", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "EU funds will cover the difference", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="A large deficit must eventually be closed. The only options are raising taxes (VAT is already increasing to 21%), cutting services, or allowing inflation to erode the real value of debt. Understanding this context makes local budget oversight even more important."
/>

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-03-q2"
  question="A town has personnel costs at 71% of budget, investment execution at 36%, and 3 rectifications. How many red flags is this?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "1-2 red flags", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "3-4 red flags", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "5+ red flags", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "No red flags — these are normal", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This case shows 3 clear red flags: (1) Personnel crowding out at 71% (greater than 60% threshold), (2) Low investment execution at 36% (less than 70% threshold), and (3) Frequent rectifications at 3 (3 or more threshold). This combination warrants investigation."
/>

## Take Action

You've learned to recognize and analyze budget red flags. Now put that knowledge to work:

- [ ] **Check your local government** for all 7 red flags
- [ ] **Compare with at least 2 similar localities** — Is yours better, worse, or average?
- [ ] **Prepare questions** based on red flags found — These become your FOIA requests
- [ ] **Track over time** — Are things improving or getting worse?

---

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Budget oversight is most valuable when applied systematically. Check every red flag, document your findings, compare with peers, and follow up with questions. Romania's fiscal pressures make this work more important than ever — every lei of waste or corruption is a lei that could have built a school or fixed a road.
