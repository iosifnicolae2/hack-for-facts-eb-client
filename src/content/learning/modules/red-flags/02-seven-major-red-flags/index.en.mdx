# The Seven Major Red Flags

## Concept Introduction

Now that you understand how to think about red flags, let's examine the seven most common warning signs in Romanian public budgets. Each flag has a specific pattern, a reason it matters, and questions you should ask when you spot it.

These seven flags aren't theoretical — they're drawn from real patterns observed across hundreds of Romanian local governments. Mastering them gives you a powerful toolkit for budget oversight.

> **Key Insight:** Each red flag has three parts: **what it looks like**, **why it's a problem**, and **what questions to ask**.

## The Seven Red Flags in Detail

### 🚩 Red Flag #1: Low Execution Rates

**What It Looks Like:**
- Investment (Code 71 - Cheltuieli de capital) execution significantly below allocated budget
- Money allocated but not spent
- Especially common for capital projects

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Infrastructure promised but not delivered
- Schools, hospitals, roads not built
- EU funds at risk of being lost

> **Legal Context:** Romanian law contains no fixed percentage threshold for acceptable execution rates. However, **OUG 90/2023** establishes that if execution falls below **50% by October 31**, credit orderers must transfer minimum 10% of remaining credits to the Government Reserve Fund. Court of Accounts audits typically observe 70-90% execution rates as a practical benchmark.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why was only X% of the investment budget spent?"
- "Which projects were cancelled or delayed?"
- "Will the money be reallocated or lost?"

> **Example:** City X planned 50M RON for road repairs. Actual spending: 22M RON (44%). Result: Only 3 of 7 planned roads were repaired.

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #2: Frequent Rectifications

**What It Looks Like:**
- Multiple budget amendments in a single year with large changes
- Significant shifts (>15% of original budget)
- Changes timed near elections

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Poor initial planning
- Political manipulation of priorities
- Unreliable budget as policy tool

> **Legal Context (Law 273/2006, Art. 19):** There is **no legal limit** on how many rectifications are permitted per year. Rectifications may be approved within 30 days of state budget rectification, based on substantiated proposals. However, **budget balance must be maintained** and **deliberative authority (local council) approval** is required for all rectifications. While legal, frequent large changes suggest planning issues.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why was the original budget so inaccurate?"
- "Who benefited from each rectification?"
- "Were any cuts made to fund increases elsewhere?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #3: Arrears (Arierate)

**What It Looks Like:**
- Unpaid bills accumulating
- "Arrears" appearing in execution reports
- Growing debt to suppliers

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Institution is spending beyond its means
- Suppliers may stop providing services
- Hidden debt that must eventually be paid

> **Legal Definition (Law 273/2006, Art. 2(4¹)):** Arrears are outstanding payments with maturity of more than **90 days** from the due date. Credit orderers with arrears must **reduce their volume monthly by at least 5%**. Non-compliance triggers **automatic suspension** of defalcated quotas and sums from state budget revenues. Units with arrears **cannot authorize new loans** until cleared.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What is the current arrears balance?"
- "How long have these bills been unpaid (90+ days = arierate)?"
- "Is there a plan to achieve the required 5% monthly reduction?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #4: Personnel Crowding Out Investment

**What It Looks Like:**
- Personnel costs consuming a disproportionate share of total budget
- Investment consistently \<10%
- Salary execution 99%+, investment much lower

**Why It's a Problem:**
- No money for development
- Institution maintaining status quo only
- Infrastructure deteriorating

> **Legal Context:** Romanian regulations use **maximum position limits** (OUG 63/2010) rather than percentage thresholds for personnel costs. Court of Accounts data shows personnel costs average ~46% for commune/town administrations. Only **31% of communes** could cover personnel costs from own revenues in 2023. While no legal percentage exists, high personnel-to-investment ratios remain a practical concern for development capacity.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What is the personnel-to-investment ratio?"
- "Has staffing increased while investment decreased?"
- "What development projects are being sacrificed?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #5: Contract Splitting

**What It Looks Like:**
- Multiple contracts just under the direct purchase threshold
- Same supplier, similar dates, similar services
- High percentage of direct awards

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Avoids competitive bidding
- Often leads to higher prices
- May indicate favoritism or kickbacks

> **Legal Thresholds (Law 98/2016, Art. 7(5)):**
> - **Products & Services:** 270,120 RON (~€54,300)
> - **Works (Lucrări):** 900,400 RON (~€180,900)
>
> Below these thresholds, direct purchase without tender is permitted.

**Pattern Example:**
```
Jan 5:  IT Services  - Supplier A - €53,500
Jan 12: IT Consulting - Supplier A - €53,800
Jan 20: IT Support   - Supplier A - €52,900
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: €160,200 → Should have been ONE tender!
```

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why were these contracts not bundled?"
- "How was this supplier selected each time?"
- "What is the total spent with this supplier?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #6: Emergency Procurement Abuse

**What It Looks Like:**
- High percentage of "emergency" procedures (negociere fără publicare prealabilă)
- Non-emergency items procured urgently
- Same suppliers winning repeatedly

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Bypasses competitive procedures
- Often results in higher prices
- May indicate collusion or corruption

> **Legal Requirements (Law 98/2016, Art. 104(1)(c)):** Emergency procurement requires **three cumulative conditions**:
> 1. **Extreme urgency** exists
> 2. Urgency is caused by **unforeseeable events**
> 3. Situation is **not attributable to any action or inaction** of the contracting authority
>
> These conditions are interpreted **strictly** by courts. Non-notification penalties: 5,000-30,000 lei fine.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What was the emergency that justified this? Were all three legal conditions met?"
- "Why wasn't this planned in advance (was inaction a factor)?"
- "How does this price compare to market rates?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #7: Opaque Transfers

**What It Looks Like:**
- Large amounts in "Other transfers" categories
- Money moving between entities without clear purpose
- Transfers to organizations with unclear mandates

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Hides true spending purposes
- May fund activities outside normal oversight
- Creates opportunities for misuse

> **Budget Classification (Order MFP 1954/2005):**
> - **Title VI (Code 51):** Transfers between government units - subject to explicit legal frameworks
> - **Title VII (Code 55):** Other transfers (Alte transferuri) - less specific oversight
>
> Code 55 includes internal transfers (55.01) like housing support, state aid schemes, and de minimis aid. These require deliberative authority approval but have less rigorous oversight than inter-governmental transfers.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What specific activities do these transfers fund?"
- "Who are the ultimate recipients?"
- "What outcomes were achieved?"

## Quick Reference Table

| Red Flag | Threshold / Legal Basis | Severity | Key Question |
|----------|------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Low execution | \<50% triggers OUG 90/2023 rules | HIGH | Why wasn't the money spent? |
| Frequent rectifications | No legal limit (Law 273/2006) | MEDIUM | Who benefited from changes? |
| Arrears | 90+ days overdue (Law 273/2006) | HIGH | Is the 5% monthly reduction met? |
| Personnel crowding | Position limits (OUG 63/2010) | HIGH | What's being sacrificed? |
| Contract splitting | \<€54.3k/€180.9k (Law 98/2016) | HIGH | Why weren't contracts bundled? |
| Emergency abuse | 3 cumulative conditions required | HIGH | Were all legal conditions met? |
| Opaque transfers | Code 55 has less oversight | MEDIUM | Where does money actually go? |

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-02-q1"
  question="A city has three IT contracts with the same supplier: €53,500 (Jan 5), €53,800 (Jan 12), €52,900 (Jan 20). What red flag does this most likely indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Low execution rates", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Contract splitting to avoid competitive bidding", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Personnel crowding out investment", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Frequent rectifications", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is a classic contract splitting pattern. Three contracts just under the €54,300 direct purchase threshold (€160,200 total) should have been one tender. This avoids competitive bidding and may indicate favoritism."
/>

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-02-q2"
  question="Personnel costs are 72% of a town's budget, while investment is only 8%. What is the primary concern?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Employees are overpaid", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The town has too many staff", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Little money remains for development and infrastructure", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "The budget is too large", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="When personnel costs crowd out investment, there's no room for development. While Romanian law uses position limits rather than percentage thresholds, 72% is far above the ~46% average for local administrations. Infrastructure deteriorates, and the institution can only maintain status quo."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** The seven major red flags are low execution, frequent rectifications, arrears, personnel crowding out investment, contract splitting, emergency procurement abuse, and opaque transfers. Each has specific patterns and legal bases (Law 98/2016, Law 273/2006, OUG 63/2010). Learn to spot them, and you'll see what others miss.
