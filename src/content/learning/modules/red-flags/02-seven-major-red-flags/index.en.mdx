# The Seven Major Red Flags

## Concept Introduction

Now that you understand how to think about red flags, let's examine the seven most common warning signs in Romanian public budgets. Each flag has a specific pattern, a reason it matters, and questions you should ask when you spot it.

These seven flags aren't theoretical — they're drawn from real patterns observed across hundreds of Romanian local governments. Mastering them gives you a powerful toolkit for budget oversight.

> **Key Insight:** Each red flag has three parts: **what it looks like**, **why it's a problem**, and **what questions to ask**.

## The Seven Red Flags in Detail

### 🚩 Red Flag #1: Low Execution Rates

**What It Looks Like:**
- Investment (Code 71) execution below 70%
- Money allocated but not spent
- Especially common for capital projects

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Infrastructure promised but not delivered
- Schools, hospitals, roads not built
- EU funds at risk of being lost

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why was only X% of the investment budget spent?"
- "Which projects were cancelled or delayed?"
- "Will the money be reallocated or lost?"

> **Example:** City X planned 50M RON for road repairs. Actual spending: 22M RON (44%). Result: Only 3 of 7 planned roads were repaired.

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #2: Frequent Rectifications

**What It Looks Like:**
- 3+ budget amendments in a single year
- Large changes (>15% of original budget)
- Changes timed near elections

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Poor initial planning
- Political manipulation of priorities
- Unreliable budget as policy tool

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why was the original budget so inaccurate?"
- "Who benefited from each rectification?"
- "Were any cuts made to fund increases elsewhere?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #3: Arrears (Arierate)

**What It Looks Like:**
- Unpaid bills accumulating
- "Arrears" appearing in execution reports
- Growing debt to suppliers

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Institution is spending beyond its means
- Suppliers may stop providing services
- Hidden debt that must eventually be paid

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What is the current arrears balance?"
- "How long have these bills been unpaid?"
- "Is there a plan to clear the arrears?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #4: Personnel Crowding Out Investment

**What It Looks Like:**
- Personnel costs >60% of total budget
- Investment consistently \<10%
- Salary execution 99%+, investment \<60%

**Why It's a Problem:**
- No money for development
- Institution maintaining status quo only
- Infrastructure deteriorating

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What is the personnel-to-investment ratio?"
- "Has staffing increased while investment decreased?"
- "What development projects are being sacrificed?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #5: Contract Splitting

**What It Looks Like:**
- Multiple contracts just under €27,000 threshold
- Same supplier, similar dates, similar services
- High percentage of direct awards

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Avoids competitive bidding
- Often leads to higher prices
- May indicate favoritism or kickbacks

> **€27,000** = threshold for direct purchase (no tender required)

**Pattern Example:**
```
Jan 5:  IT Services  - Supplier A - €26,500
Jan 12: IT Consulting - Supplier A - €26,800
Jan 20: IT Support   - Supplier A - €25,900
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: €79,200 → Should have been ONE tender!
```

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why were these contracts not bundled?"
- "How was this supplier selected each time?"
- "What is the total spent with this supplier?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #6: Emergency Procurement Abuse

**What It Looks Like:**
- High percentage of "emergency" procedures
- Non-emergency items procured urgently
- Same suppliers winning repeatedly

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Bypasses competitive procedures
- Often results in higher prices
- May indicate collusion or corruption

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What was the emergency that justified this?"
- "Why wasn't this planned in advance?"
- "How does this price compare to market rates?"

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #7: Opaque Transfers

**What It Looks Like:**
- Large amounts in "Other transfers" categories
- Money moving between entities without clear purpose
- Transfers to organizations with unclear mandates

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Hides true spending purposes
- May fund activities outside normal oversight
- Creates opportunities for misuse

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What specific activities do these transfers fund?"
- "Who are the ultimate recipients?"
- "What outcomes were achieved?"

---

## Quick Reference Table

| Red Flag | Threshold | Severity | Key Question |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Low execution | \<70% for investments | HIGH | Why wasn't the money spent? |
| Frequent rectifications | ≥3 per year | MEDIUM | Who benefited from changes? |
| Arrears | Any amount | HIGH | How will debts be paid? |
| Personnel crowding | \>60% of budget | HIGH | What's being sacrificed? |
| Contract splitting | \<€27k patterns | HIGH | Why weren't contracts bundled? |
| Emergency abuse | High % emergency | HIGH | What was the real emergency? |
| Opaque transfers | Large "other" amounts | MEDIUM | Where does money actually go? |

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-02-q1"
  question="A city has three IT contracts with the same supplier: €26,500 (Jan 5), €26,800 (Jan 12), €25,900 (Jan 20). What red flag does this most likely indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Low execution rates", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Contract splitting to avoid competitive bidding", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Personnel crowding out investment", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Frequent rectifications", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is a classic contract splitting pattern. Three contracts just under the €27,000 direct purchase threshold (€79,200 total) should have been one tender. This avoids competitive bidding and may indicate favoritism."
/>

<Quiz
  id="red-flags-02-q2"
  question="Personnel costs are 72% of a town's budget, while investment is only 8%. What is the primary concern?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Employees are overpaid", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The town has too many staff", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Little money remains for development and infrastructure", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "The budget is too large", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="When personnel costs crowd out investment (>60% threshold), there's no room for development. Infrastructure deteriorates, and the institution can only maintain status quo. The town isn't investing in its future."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** The seven major red flags are low execution, frequent rectifications, arrears, personnel crowding out investment, contract splitting, emergency procurement abuse, and opaque transfers. Each has specific patterns and thresholds. Learn to spot them, and you'll see what others miss.
