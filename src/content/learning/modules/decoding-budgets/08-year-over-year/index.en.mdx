# Year-over-Year Comparison

"Education budget increased by 10% this year!" The minister smiles at the press conference. Parents should be happy, right?

But wait. If inflation was 12%, that 10% "increase" is actually a **2% cut** in purchasing power. Fewer textbooks, deferred repairs, larger class sizes — despite the headline.

This is the #1 trick in budget communication. Today you'll learn to see through it.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:**
> - Calculate real (inflation-adjusted) budget changes
> - Identify the most common comparison mistakes
> - Spot misleading budget claims in news and government reports

<ExpandableHint trigger="Quick check: What's the difference between nominal and real values?">
**Nominal values** = The raw numbers as written (affected by inflation)

**Real values** = Adjusted for purchasing power (what the money actually buys)

A "10% increase" with 12% inflation = **-2% real change** (a cut)

## The Basics: Nominal vs. Real

### Nominal Values
- The actual numbers in the budget
- What you see in official documents
- Affected by inflation

### Real Values (Inflation-Adjusted)
- Nominal values adjusted for purchasing power
- Shows true change in resources
- Essential for meaningful comparison

### How to Adjust

```
Real Change = (Current Year Value / Previous Year Value × 100) - Inflation Rate
```

**Example:**
- 2023 Education Budget: 50 billion RON
- 2024 Education Budget: 55 billion RON
- Nominal increase: 10%
- Inflation 2023-2024: 7%
- Real increase: approximately 3%

## Finding Comparable Categories

Budget categories change over time. Before comparing:

### Check for Reclassifications
- Did functions move between ministries?
- Were new subcategories created?
- Did economic classification codes change?

### Adjust for Scope Changes
- New programs added → might need to exclude for like-for-like comparison
- Programs ended → might need to add back
- Merged entities → combine historical data

### Use Consistent Perimeters
Compare the same set of entities across years. If a new hospital opened, decide whether to include it in both years or exclude it.

## Key Metrics to Track

### Growth Rates

| Metric | Formula | What It Shows |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Nominal Growth** | (New - Old) / Old × 100 | Headline change |
| **Real Growth** | Nominal Growth - Inflation | True resource change |
| **Per Capita Growth** | Real Growth - Population Growth | Per-person change |

### Shares

| Metric | Formula | What It Shows |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Share of Total** | Category / Total Budget × 100 | Priority relative to others |
| **Share of GDP** | Category / GDP × 100 | Priority relative to economy |
| **Share Change** | Current Share - Previous Share | Shifting priorities |

## Common Comparison Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Inflation
The #1 mistake. A "flat" budget is actually a cut in real terms.

### 2. Wrong Baseline Year
Picking an unusual year (pandemic, crisis) as baseline distorts the picture.

### 3. Mixing Planned and Executed
Compare planned to planned, executed to executed. Not planned to executed.

### 4. Ignoring Rectifications
Compare final/rectified budgets, not just initial budgets.

### 5. Cherry-Picking Periods
Choosing periods that support a narrative rather than showing the full picture.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="year-over-year-quiz"
  question="If a budget increases by 5% nominally but inflation is 8%, what happened in real terms?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The budget increased by 5%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The budget increased by 13%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "The budget decreased by approximately 3%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "We cannot determine without more information", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Real change = Nominal change - Inflation. So 5% - 8% = -3%. Despite the nominal 'increase,' the budget actually decreased in real (purchasing power) terms. This is a common way governments can claim increases while actually cutting resources."

## Quick Reference: Comparison Terms

<FlashCardDeck
  cards={[
    { front: "Nominal Change", back: "The headline number — raw percentage increase/decrease without adjusting for inflation. Often misleading." },
    { front: "Real Change", back: "Nominal change MINUS inflation. Shows actual purchasing power change. A 5% nominal increase with 8% inflation = -3% real change." },
    { front: "Per Capita Change", back: "Real change MINUS population change. Shows change in spending per person. Account for demographic shifts." },
    { front: "Cherry-picking", back: "Selecting start/end dates that support a narrative. Always ask: why these dates?" },
    { front: "Baseline year", back: "The starting point for comparison. Avoid unusual years (pandemic, crisis) as baselines." }

## Key Takeaways

> **Remember:**
> - **Always adjust for inflation** — a 5% increase with 8% inflation is a 3% cut
> - **Compare like with like** — planned to planned, executed to executed
> - **Check for reclassifications** — categories shift between years
> - **Be skeptical of headlines** — ask "nominal or real?"

**Try This:** Next time you hear "budget increased X%", immediately ask: "What was inflation that year?" Calculate the real change.
