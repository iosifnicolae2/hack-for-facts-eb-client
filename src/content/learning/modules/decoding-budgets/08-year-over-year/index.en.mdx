# Year-over-Year Comparison

## Concept Introduction

Comparing this year's budget to last year's seems simple - but doing it correctly requires accounting for inflation, structural changes, and proper baselines.

> **Key Insight:** A budget that "increased by 5%" might actually be a cut if inflation was 10%. Always adjust for inflation when comparing years.

## The Basics: Nominal vs. Real

### Nominal Values
- The actual numbers in the budget
- What you see in official documents
- Affected by inflation

### Real Values (Inflation-Adjusted)
- Nominal values adjusted for purchasing power
- Shows true change in resources
- Essential for meaningful comparison

### How to Adjust

```
Real Change = (Current Year Value / Previous Year Value × 100) - Inflation Rate
```

**Example:**
- 2023 Education Budget: 50 billion RON
- 2024 Education Budget: 55 billion RON
- Nominal increase: 10%
- Inflation 2023-2024: 7%
- Real increase: approximately 3%

## Finding Comparable Categories

Budget categories change over time. Before comparing:

### Check for Reclassifications
- Did functions move between ministries?
- Were new subcategories created?
- Did economic classification codes change?

### Adjust for Scope Changes
- New programs added → might need to exclude for like-for-like comparison
- Programs ended → might need to add back
- Merged entities → combine historical data

### Use Consistent Perimeters
Compare the same set of entities across years. If a new hospital opened, decide whether to include it in both years or exclude it.

## Key Metrics to Track

### Growth Rates

| Metric | Formula | What It Shows |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Nominal Growth** | (New - Old) / Old × 100 | Headline change |
| **Real Growth** | Nominal Growth - Inflation | True resource change |
| **Per Capita Growth** | Real Growth - Population Growth | Per-person change |

### Shares

| Metric | Formula | What It Shows |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Share of Total** | Category / Total Budget × 100 | Priority relative to others |
| **Share of GDP** | Category / GDP × 100 | Priority relative to economy |
| **Share Change** | Current Share - Previous Share | Shifting priorities |

## Common Comparison Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Inflation
The #1 mistake. A "flat" budget is actually a cut in real terms.

### 2. Wrong Baseline Year
Picking an unusual year (pandemic, crisis) as baseline distorts the picture.

### 3. Mixing Planned and Executed
Compare planned to planned, executed to executed. Not planned to executed.

### 4. Ignoring Rectifications
Compare final/rectified budgets, not just initial budgets.

### 5. Cherry-Picking Periods
Choosing periods that support a narrative rather than showing the full picture.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="year-over-year-quiz"
  question="If a budget increases by 5% nominally but inflation is 8%, what happened in real terms?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The budget increased by 5%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The budget increased by 13%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "The budget decreased by approximately 3%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "We cannot determine without more information", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Real change = Nominal change - Inflation. So 5% - 8% = -3%. Despite the nominal 'increase,' the budget actually decreased in real (purchasing power) terms. This is a common way governments can claim increases while actually cutting resources."

## Key Takeaway

> Meaningful year-over-year comparison requires adjusting for inflation, ensuring comparable categories, and using consistent baselines. Always convert to real terms and be skeptical of nominal increases that don't exceed inflation.
