# Common Analysis Mistakes

A well-known news outlet reports: "Government slashes education by 40%!" Social media explodes. Politicians demand resignations.

Three days later, a correction: staff were moved to a different ministry, not cut. The budget decreased because the responsibility moved. Zero jobs lost.

This wasn't malicious — it was a common analytical error. Today you'll learn to spot six mistakes that trap even experienced analysts.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:**
> - Identify six common budget analysis errors
> - Explain why each error leads to wrong conclusions
> - Apply a pre-publication checklist to your own analysis

<ExpandableHint trigger="Can you guess the most common budget analysis mistake before we reveal it?">
**#1 Mistake: Ignoring Inflation**

A "flat" budget is actually a cut. A 5% increase with 8% inflation is a 3% cut. Most headlines report nominal figures, not real ones. This is the easiest mistake to make — and to spot.

## Mistake #1: Confusing Planned vs. Executed

### The Error
Claiming spending "increased" by comparing last year's executed budget to this year's planned budget.

### Why It's Wrong
Planned budgets are always aspirational. They often differ significantly from actual execution.

### Correct Approach
- Compare planned to planned
- Compare executed to executed
- Explicitly note which you're using

### Example
"Education budget increased 15% this year" - but if comparing 2023 execution to 2024 plan, you're comparing reality to aspiration.

## Mistake #2: Ignoring Inflation

### The Error
Celebrating nominal increases without adjusting for inflation.

### Why It's Wrong
A 5% increase with 8% inflation is actually a 3% cut in real terms.

### Correct Approach
- Always calculate real (inflation-adjusted) changes
- Note the inflation rate used
- Be skeptical of nominal claims

### Example
"Health spending is at an all-time high!" - technically true in nominal terms, but might be lower as share of GDP or in real terms than 10 years ago.

---

## Mistake #3: Cherry-Picking Periods

### The Error
Choosing start and end dates that support your narrative.

### Why It's Wrong
Any trend can look positive or negative depending on period selection.

### Correct Approach
- Use consistent time periods
- Show the full trend
- Explain why you chose specific dates
- Avoid unusual base years (pandemic, crisis)

### Example
Claiming spending "doubled since 2020" when 2020 was abnormally low due to pandemic disruptions.

---

## Mistake #4: Ignoring Classification Changes

### The Error
Comparing categories that were redefined between years.

### Why It's Wrong
A "decrease" might just be money moved to a different category.

### Correct Approach
- Check for reclassifications
- Adjust historical data if possible
- Note any methodological changes

### Example
"Administration costs dropped 40%!" - but staff were moved to a different ministry, not cut.

---

## Mistake #5: Correlation vs. Causation

### The Error
Assuming budget changes caused outcome changes.

### Why It's Wrong
Many factors affect outcomes. Budget is just one.

### Correct Approach
- Be cautious about causal claims
- Consider other factors
- Use qualified language ("associated with," not "caused by")

### Example
"Crime dropped after police budget increased" - but many factors affect crime rates. The budget increase may be coincidental.

---

## Mistake #6: Ignoring the Denominator

### The Error
Focusing only on absolute numbers without considering population or economy changes.

### Why It's Wrong
A country's economy and population change. Raw numbers don't tell the full story.

### Correct Approach
- Use per capita figures
- Use percentage of GDP
- Consider demographic changes

### Example
"Pension spending increased 50%!" - but if the number of pensioners also increased 50%, spending per pensioner is unchanged.

## Pre-Publication Checklist

<ExpandableHint trigger="Click to reveal the 6-point checklist every analyst should use">
Before publishing any budget analysis, verify:

**1. ☐ SAME DATA TYPE**
Am I comparing planned to planned, or executed to executed? (Never mix them)

**2. ☐ INFLATION ADJUSTED**
Have I calculated the real (inflation-adjusted) change?

**3. ☐ APPROPRIATE PERIOD**
Is my time period explained? Am I avoiding unusual baseline years?

**4. ☐ UNCHANGED CLASSIFICATIONS**
Did categories change between years? Were responsibilities moved?

**5. ☐ NO OVERCLAIMING**
Am I saying "associated with" rather than "caused by"?

**6. ☐ PROPERLY NORMALIZED**
Have I adjusted for population, GDP, or other relevant denominators?

If any answer is "no" or "I don't know" — stop and investigate before publishing.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="common-mistakes-q1"
  question="A government claims 'education spending reached a record high this year.' What question should you ask first?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "How does it compare to other countries?", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Is that in nominal or real (inflation-adjusted) terms?", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Which party is in power?", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "What did they spend on defense?", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="'Record high' claims are almost always in nominal terms. With consistent inflation, nominal spending will naturally reach new highs each year. The first question should be whether the increase exceeds inflation — is this a real increase in resources or just inflation?"
/>

<Quiz
  id="common-mistakes-q2"
  question="A news report says 'Ministry X budget cut by 35%!' but staff were moved to Ministry Y. What mistake did the journalist make?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Ignoring inflation", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Ignoring reclassifications", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Cherry-picking periods", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Confusing planned vs executed", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is a reclassification error. When responsibilities move between ministries, the budget follows. The ministry's budget decreased not because of cuts, but because the work (and money) is now elsewhere. Always check if categories or responsibilities changed."
