# Key Dates and Participation Windows

## Concept Introduction

The budget isn't decided in a single moment - it's a year-long process with specific windows when citizens can have influence. Knowing these dates helps you engage at the right time.

> **Key Insight:** By the time the budget is voted in Parliament, most decisions are already made. Early engagement during drafting phases has the most impact.

## Romania's Annual Budget Calendar

### National Budget Timeline

| When | What Happens | Your Opportunity |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **January-June** | Ministries prepare needs | Limited - internal planning |
| **July-August** | MF drafts budget framework | Fiscal Strategy published - review assumptions |
| **September-October** | Draft budget prepared | Internal government negotiations |
| **November 15** | Budget submitted to Parliament | Draft becomes public - analyze and comment |
| **November-December** | Parliamentary debate | Contact MPs, attend public sessions |
| **December 15-31** | Budget vote | Final chance to influence amendments |
| **January 1** | Budget takes effect | Execution monitoring begins |

### Mid-Year Events

| When | What Happens | Your Opportunity |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **April** | Q1 execution reports | Check early trends |
| **July** | H1 execution review | Assess 6-month progress |
| **August-September** | Budget rectification | Major mid-year changes - second chance to engage |
| **October-November** | Second rectification (if needed) | Usually smaller adjustments |

## Local Budget Timeline

Local budgets follow a different schedule:

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **January-February** | Draft local budget prepared |
| **February** | Public hearing required by law |
| **February-March** | Local council vote |
| **Throughout year** | Rectifications as needed |

> **Important:** Local budget public hearings are your best opportunity for direct input. They're legally required and often poorly attended - your voice can have real impact.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="key-dates-quiz"
  question="When is the BEST time to influence budget decisions?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "After the budget is voted in December", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "During the parliamentary debate in November-December", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "When the draft budget is first published in November", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "During the Fiscal Strategy phase in July-August, before the draft is finalized", isCorrect: true }
  ]}
  explanation="The earlier you engage, the more influence you can have. By the time the draft reaches Parliament, most decisions are locked in. The Fiscal Strategy phase (July-August) is when assumptions are still being debated and there's more flexibility."

## Key Takeaway

> The budget process has specific windows for citizen input. July-August (Fiscal Strategy), November (draft publication), and February (local public hearings) are key moments. Early engagement has the most impact - by the final vote, most decisions are already made.
