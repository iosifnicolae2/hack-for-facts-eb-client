# Cross-Referencing Classifications

A local journalist discovers that "Education spending increased 15% this year!" The government celebrates. But parents are frustrated — school buildings are crumbling. How can both be true?

The answer lies in **cross-referencing**: looking at the same money through both classification lenses simultaneously.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:**
> - Combine functional and economic classifications to reveal spending priorities
> - Build a cross-reference matrix to answer complex budget questions
> - Identify when "increased spending" masks shifted priorities

<ExpandableHint trigger="Quick recall: What do functional and economic classifications each tell you?">
**Functional classification** answers: "What PURPOSE does this serve?" (Education, Health, Defense)

**Economic classification** answers: "What TYPE of expense is this?" (Personnel, Goods, Investments)

Combined, they reveal not just HOW MUCH goes to education, but whether it goes to **teachers (personnel)** or **school buildings (investments)**.

## The Power of Two Lenses

Single classifications answer simple questions. Cross-referencing answers complex ones:

| Single View Question | Cross-Referenced Question |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| How much goes to Education? | How much of Education spending is capital investment vs. salaries? |
| What are total personnel costs? | Which sectors have the highest personnel costs? |
| How much capital investment? | Is capital investment going to hospitals or roads? |

The journalist's paradox is now solvable: education spending increased overall, but the increase went entirely to personnel costs (higher salaries), while capital investment (school buildings) was cut.

## Building a Cross-Reference Matrix

### Step 1: Identify Your Question

Example: "Is education spending going to teacher salaries or school construction?"

### Step 2: Find Both Classifications

- **Functional:** Chapter 65 - Education
- **Economic:** Code 10 - Personnel, Code 20 - Goods/Services, Code 71 - Capital Investments

### Step 3: Create a Matrix

| Education Sub-category | Personnel (10) | Goods/Services (20) | Capital (71) | Total |
|------------------------|-----------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Pre-school (65.02.01) | 500M | 100M | 50M | 650M |
| Primary/Secondary (65.02.03-04) | 2,000M | 300M | 200M | 2,500M |
| Higher Education (65.01.05) | 800M | 200M | 150M | 1,150M |
| **Total** | **3,300M** | **600M** | **400M** | **4,300M** |

<ExpandableHint trigger="What patterns do you notice? Take a moment to calculate percentages before revealing.">
**Key Patterns:**
- **77%** of education spending is personnel (teachers, staff salaries)
- Only **9%** is capital investment (buildings, equipment, renovations)
- **14%** is goods and services (utilities, supplies, maintenance)

This means for every 100 RON spent on education, only 9 RON builds or repairs school infrastructure. If that 9% gets cut, buildings deteriorate — even while total spending increases.

### Step 4: Compare Year-over-Year

Now add last year's data side-by-side:

| Category | Personnel 2023 | Personnel 2024 | Change | Capital 2023 | Capital 2024 | Change |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Education | 3,000M | 3,300M | +10% | 600M | 400M | **-33%** |

**The Story:** Personnel spending increased 10%, but capital investment was slashed by a third. The government can claim "education spending up!" while parents see fewer renovations.

## Three Patterns to Watch For

### Pattern 1: The Operations Trap

When personnel costs grow faster than investment:

| Year | Personnel | Capital | Interpretation |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 2021 | 70% | 15% | Normal balance |
| 2022 | 75% | 12% | Operations growing |
| 2023 | 80% | 8% | ⚠️ Infrastructure neglected |
| 2024 | 85% | 5% | 🚨 Operations trap |

This pattern means an institution is spending more to maintain bureaucracy while infrastructure deteriorates.

### Pattern 2: The Hollow Priority

Government claims sector X is a priority, but cross-referencing shows:
- Total spending increased ✓
- But all increase went to personnel
- Capital investment decreased
- Net effect: same services, just more expensive

### Pattern 3: The Hidden Shift

Capital cuts in one sector fund increases in another:

| Sector | 2023 Capital | 2024 Capital | Change |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Education (65) | 600M | 400M | -33% |
| Defense (60) | 200M | 400M | +100% |

The government can claim "we didn't cut education" (total unchanged) while actually redirecting infrastructure money.

## Common Pitfalls

<ExpandableHint trigger="Before reading the pitfalls, can you guess what might go wrong when cross-referencing?">
Common mistakes include:
1. **Double-counting** — Some spending appears in multiple categories
2. **Classification changes** — Categories shift between years
3. **Missing context** — High personnel isn't always bad (education is labor-intensive)
4. **Ignoring transfers** — Money moves between entities with different classifications

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="cross-referencing-q1"
  question="A government claims 'Health spending is up 12%!' Cross-referencing shows personnel +18%, capital -25%. What's really happening?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Healthcare is improving", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "More doctors being hired for new hospitals", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Higher salaries but fewer new facilities — infrastructure neglected", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "The data is inconsistent", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is a classic 'hollow priority' pattern. Total spending is up, so the government's claim is technically true. But the composition shifted: personnel costs rose (likely salary increases) while capital investment dropped significantly. Result: same or fewer facilities, higher operating costs, deteriorating infrastructure."

<Quiz
  id="cross-referencing-q2"
  question="What can cross-referencing functional and economic classifications reveal that single classifications cannot?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The total amount spent on education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The total personnel costs across all sectors", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "What proportion of education spending goes to teachers versus school buildings", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Which ministry manages education", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Cross-referencing combines the 'what' (functional - education) with the 'how' (economic - personnel vs capital) to reveal how money within a sector is actually allocated. Single classifications can only answer one dimension at a time."

## Key Takeaways

> **Remember:**
> - Cross-referencing reveals **how** money is spent within each sector
> - Watch for the "operations trap" — personnel rising while capital shrinks
> - "Increased spending" can mask shifted priorities — always check the composition
> - Build matrices to answer questions like: "Is health money going to doctors or hospitals?"

**Try This:** Pick any sector on Transparenta.eu. Build a simple matrix: Personnel vs. Capital for the last 3 years. What pattern do you see?
