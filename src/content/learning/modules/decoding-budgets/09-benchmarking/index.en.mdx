# Benchmarking and Comparisons

## Concept Introduction

Comparing budgets between different entities - cities, countries, or sectors - requires careful methodology. A €1 billion healthcare budget might be generous for one country and inadequate for another.

> **Key Insight:** Raw numbers are meaningless without context. Benchmarking provides that context by normalizing for size, population, and other factors.

## Types of Benchmarking

### 1. Internal Benchmarking
Compare an entity to itself over time.
- This year vs. last year
- Actual vs. planned
- Current period vs. same period last year

### 2. Peer Benchmarking
Compare similar entities to each other.
- Cities of similar size
- Counties with similar demographics
- Hospitals with similar capacity

### 3. External Benchmarking
Compare against external standards.
- EU averages
- OECD benchmarks
- International commitments (e.g., NATO 2% defense)

## Normalization Techniques

### Per Capita
Divides spending by population.

```
Per Capita = Total Spending / Population
```

**Use when:** Comparing entities of different sizes
**Example:** City A spends €500M on roads, City B spends €100M. Per capita might show City B actually spends more per resident.

### As Percentage of GDP/Budget
Shows priority relative to total resources.

```
Share of GDP = Spending / GDP × 100
```

**Use when:** Comparing priorities across entities
**Example:** Country A spends 6% of GDP on health, Country B spends 4%. Even if A's absolute spending is lower, health is a higher priority.

### Per Output Unit
Measures efficiency.

```
Cost per Unit = Total Spending / Units Produced
```

**Use when:** Comparing efficiency
**Example:** Cost per student, cost per hospital bed, cost per km of road maintained.

## Romania in European Context

| Indicator | Romania | EU Average | Rank |
|-----------|---------|------------|------|
| Tax Revenue (% GDP) | ~28-29% | ~40% | 2nd lowest (after Ireland) |
| Health Spending (% GDP) | ~5.7-6% | ~10% | Lowest in EU |
| Education Spending (% GDP) | ~2.9-3% | ~4.6% | Lowest in EU |
| Defense Spending (% GDP) | ~2.26% | ~1.5% | Above average (meets NATO target) |
| VAT Gap | ~30% | ~9-10% | Worst in EU |

*Data as of 2023-2024. Sources: Eurostat, European Commission.*

### What This Means
Romania collects less revenue and spends less on services than most EU peers. When analyzing Romanian budgets, EU benchmarks show how much room for improvement exists.

## Choosing Good Peers

### Good Peer Characteristics
- Similar size (population, economy)
- Similar structure (federal vs. unitary, urban vs. rural)
- Similar development level
- Comparable data availability

### Poor Peer Choices
- Dramatically different size
- Different governmental structure
- Different economic development
- Incomparable data definitions

**For Romania:** Good peers might include Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary (similar size, EU members, post-transition economies). Poor peers: Germany, France (much larger, different structure).

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="benchmarking-quiz"
  question="City A has a total budget of €1 billion and 500,000 residents. City B has a €500 million budget and 200,000 residents. Which spends more per capita?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "City A (€1 billion is more than €500 million)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "City B (€2,500 per capita vs €2,000 per capita)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "They're equal", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Cannot be determined", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="City A: €1B / 500K = €2,000 per capita. City B: €500M / 200K = €2,500 per capita. Despite having a smaller total budget, City B spends 25% more per resident. This is why normalization is essential for meaningful comparison."

## Key Takeaway

> Raw budget numbers are meaningless without normalization. Use per capita figures for size comparison, percentage of GDP for priority comparison, and per-unit costs for efficiency comparison. Choose appropriate peers and be aware of Romania's position relative to EU averages.
