# Understanding Budget Entities

## Concept Introduction

Romania has thousands of public institutions, each with its own budget. Understanding how they relate to each other - and how money flows between them - is essential for tracking public spending.

> **Key Insight:** Money doesn't go directly from the Ministry of Finance to your local school. It passes through a hierarchy of budget holders, each with their own allocation decisions.

---

## The Budget Hierarchy

### Primary Budget Holders (Ordonatori Principali de Credite)

These are the top-level entities that receive allocations directly from the national budget:

- **Ministries** (e.g., Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health)
- **Parliament and Presidency**
- **Judicial system** (courts, prosecutors)
- **Autonomous institutions** (Romanian Academy, etc.)
- **Local councils** (for local budgets)

### Secondary Budget Holders

Receive funds from primary holders:
- Regional education inspectorates
- Public health directorates
- Deconcentrated services of ministries

### Tertiary Budget Holders

Receive funds from secondary holders:
- Individual schools
- Individual hospitals
- Local institutions

## How Money Flows: An Example

**From Ministry of Education to Your Local School:**

```
Ministry of Education (Ordonator Principal)
    ↓
County School Inspectorate (Ordonator Secundar)
    ↓
Your Local School (Ordonator Tertiar)
```

At each level, the holder decides how to allocate within their limits. The local school receives what's passed down, not what was originally allocated at the top.

## Why This Matters for Analysis

### Finding the Right Data

If you want to analyze school spending:
- National totals → Ministry of Education budget
- County patterns → Inspectorate budgets
- Individual school → That school's specific allocation

### Understanding Discrepancies

If national education budget increases but your school's budget decreases, the gap might be at:
- Inspectorate allocation decisions
- Different priorities between regions
- Specific school circumstances

### Following the Money

Transfers between entities can obscure spending. Money might be allocated to one entity but executed by another.

## Types of Public Entities

| Type | Examples | Budget Source |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Central Administration** | Ministries, agencies | State budget |
| **Local Administration** | City halls, county councils | Local budget + transfers |
| **Public Institutions** | Schools, hospitals, museums | Parent entity allocation |
| **State-Owned Enterprises** | CFR, Posta Romana | Own revenue + subsidies |
| **Autonomous Bodies** | Universities, Romanian Academy | Mixed sources |

## Finding Entity Budgets

### National Entities
- Ministry of Finance portal (mfinante.gov.ro)
- Individual ministry websites
- Official Gazette (for budget law annexes)

### Local Entities
- City/county council websites
- Local transparency portals
- Direct request under Law 544/2001

### Specific Institutions
- Transparenta.eu entity search
- Institution's own website
- Annual reports and financial statements

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="budget-entities-quiz"
  question="If the Ministry of Education's total budget increases by 10%, what can you conclude about individual school budgets?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "All schools automatically get 10% more", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Schools get more, but the exact amount depends on allocation decisions at each level", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Schools don't receive money from the Ministry of Education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Only new schools benefit from the increase", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Money flows through a hierarchy: Ministry → Inspectorate → School. At each level, budget holders make allocation decisions. A 10% increase at the top doesn't automatically mean 10% more at the bottom - it depends on how each level distributes funds."

## Key Takeaway

> Public spending flows through a hierarchy of budget holders. Understanding this structure helps you find the right data for analysis and explains why national budget changes don't always reach individual institutions as expected. Always trace money through the complete chain.
