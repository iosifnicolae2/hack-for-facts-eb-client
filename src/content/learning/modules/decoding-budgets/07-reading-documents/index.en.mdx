# Reading Official Budget Documents

## Concept Introduction

> **Key Insight:** Budget documents follow predictable patterns. Learn the structure once, and you can navigate any Romanian budget document.

## The Annual Budget Law Structure

The annual state budget law (Legea bugetului de stat) typically contains:

### Main Body
- **Article 1:** Total revenue and expenditure figures
- **Articles 2-10:** Key policy provisions, transfers, limits
- **Final articles:** Implementation rules

### Annexes (Where the Data Lives)

| Annex | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Annex 1** | Summary of state budget (revenues and expenditures) |
| **Annex 2** | Synthesis of local budgets |
| **Annex 3** | State budget expenditures by functional classification |
| **Annex 3/XX** | Individual ministry/institution budgets |
| **Annex 4** | Social insurance budget |
| **Annex 5** | Health insurance budget |
| **Annex 6** | Unemployment insurance budget |

### Finding Specific Information

**To find Ministry of Education spending:**
1. Go to Annex 3 (functional classification)
2. Find Chapter 65 (Education)
3. Or go directly to Annex 3/07 (Ministry of Education specific annex)

## Key Sections to Look For

### Revenue Tables
- Columns: Category code, Name, Previous year, Current approved, Proposed
- Look for: Tax revenue by type, Non-tax revenue, Transfers received

### Expenditure Tables
- Columns: Classification code, Name, Credits (approved budget), Usually broken by economic classification
- Look for: Title (economic category), Article (subcategory), Line item details

### Explanatory Notes
Budget proposals include explanatory memoranda (Nota de fundamentare) with:
- Economic assumptions
- Policy justifications
- Year-over-year changes explained

---

## Reading Budget Execution Reports

Monthly and quarterly execution reports show what was actually spent:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Credite aprobate** | Approved budget (what was planned) |
| **Credite definitive** | Final credits (after rectifications) |
| **Plati efectuate** | Actual payments made |
| **Procent de realizare** | Execution rate (%) |

### What to Look For
- Large gaps between approved and definitive credits (mid-year changes)
- Low execution rates (money not being spent)
- Over-execution (spending more than planned)

---

## Common Terminology

| Romanian Term | English | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Credite bugetare** | Budget credits | Approved spending authority |
| **Credite de angajament** | Commitment credits | Authority to enter contracts |
| **Plati** | Payments | Actual money disbursed |
| **Rectificare** | Rectification | Mid-year budget amendment |
| **Ordonator** | Budget holder | Institution with spending authority |
| **Titlu** | Title | Economic classification level 1 |
| **Capitol** | Chapter | Functional classification level 1 |

## Tips for Navigation

### 1. Use the Table of Contents
Most budget documents start with a detailed table of contents. Use it.

### 2. Search by Code
If you know the classification code (e.g., 65.03 for secondary education), search for it directly.

### 3. Compare Columns
Always look at planned vs. actual, current year vs. previous year.

### 4. Check the Annexes
The main law is summary only. Detail is in the annexes.

### 5. Download the Data Format
When available, download Excel/CSV versions instead of PDFs. Much easier to analyze.

    { id: "b", text: "In Annex 3 (functional classification) or the ministry-specific annex", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "In the explanatory memorandum only", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Budget documents don't include ministry-level detail", isCorrect: false }
  ]}

## Key Takeaway

> Official budget documents follow a consistent structure. The main law body contains summary provisions; the real data is in the annexes. Learn to navigate by classification codes, compare planned vs. actual figures, and always check execution reports to see what really happened.
