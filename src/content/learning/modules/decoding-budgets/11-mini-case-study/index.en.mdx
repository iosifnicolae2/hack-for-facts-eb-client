# Mini Case Study: Analyzing a Real Budget

## Introduction

Now it's time to put everything together. In this lesson, we'll walk through a systematic analysis of a real budget entity, applying all the skills you've learned.

> **Goal:** By the end of this lesson, you'll have a repeatable framework for analyzing any Romanian public budget.

---

## The Scenario

You've been asked to analyze your local city's budget. A friend claims "the city is spending less on education this year." Is this true?

Let's systematically investigate.

---

## Step 1: Find the Data

### Where to Look
1. **City website** → Usually has budget section under "Transparency"
2. **data.gov.ro** → Search for your city name + "buget"
3. **Transparenta.eu** → Use the entity search

### What to Download
- Current year's approved budget (initial + rectifications)
- Previous year's executed budget
- At least 3 years if analyzing trends

### What We Found (Example: A Medium-Sized City)

| Year | Education Budget (Planned) | Education Budget (Executed) |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 2022 | 45M RON | 42M RON (93% execution) |
| 2023 | 48M RON | 44M RON (92% execution) |
| 2024 | 50M RON | (in progress) |

---

## Step 2: Apply Classifications

### Functional View
Education spending falls under Chapter 65 "Education" in the functional classification.

Check what's included:
- Pre-school (kindergartens)
- Primary and secondary schools
- High schools (if any are city-managed)
- School infrastructure
- School transport

### Economic View
Breaking down by economic classification:
- Personnel costs (salaries): 60%
- Goods and services: 25%
- Capital expenditure: 15%

### Cross-Reference Insight
If capital expenditure dropped significantly, it might mean fewer school renovations - even if total education spending increased.

---

## Step 3: Normalize and Compare

### Nominal Check
2023 → 2024: 48M → 50M = +4.2% nominal increase

### Inflation Adjustment
Inflation 2023-2024: ~7%
Real change: 4.2% - 7% = **-2.8% real decrease**

### Per Capita Check
If school-age population changed:
- 2023: 12,000 students → 44M / 12,000 = 3,667 RON/student
- 2024: 11,500 students → 50M / 11,500 = 4,348 RON/student
- Per-student increase: +18.6%

### What This Tells Us
The nominal budget increased, but in real terms it decreased. However, per student, spending actually increased significantly due to demographic decline.

---

## Step 4: Check for Context

### Classification Changes
Did the city move any education-related spending to another category?
- Check if school meals moved to "Social assistance"
- Check if school transport moved to "Transport"

### One-Time Items
- Was there major renovation in 2023 that won't repeat?
- Are there new EU-funded projects not in the main budget?

### Execution Patterns
Historical execution rate is ~93%. If the city only executed 85% this year, the actual spending might be even lower.

---

## Step 5: Form Conclusions

### Our Findings

| Metric | Change | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Nominal budget | +4.2% | Headline increase |
| Real (inflation-adjusted) | -2.8% | Less purchasing power |
| Per student | +18.6% | More per child |
| Capital expenditure | -30% | Fewer renovations |

### Nuanced Answer
"The city is spending less on education" is:
- **True** in real terms (after inflation)
- **False** per student (more per child)
- **True** for infrastructure (capital cuts)

The friend's claim is partially correct but lacks nuance.

## Your Analysis Template

Use this checklist for any budget analysis:

### 1. Data Collection
- [ ] Identify the entity (city, ministry, hospital, etc.)
- [ ] Find current and historical budget documents
- [ ] Note: planned vs executed, initial vs rectified

### 2. Classification Analysis
- [ ] What functional category/chapter?
- [ ] What economic breakdown?
- [ ] Any cross-references of interest?

### 3. Comparison
- [ ] Calculate nominal change
- [ ] Adjust for inflation (real change)
- [ ] Normalize if needed (per capita, per unit)
- [ ] Compare to peers or benchmarks

### 4. Context
- [ ] Check for reclassifications
- [ ] Identify one-time items
- [ ] Review execution rates
- [ ] Consider external factors

### 5. Conclusions
- [ ] State findings clearly
- [ ] Acknowledge limitations
- [ ] Avoid overclaiming causation
- [ ] Identify follow-up questions

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="case-study-quiz"
  question="A city's healthcare budget went from 30M RON to 33M RON (10% increase). Inflation was 8%. The city population grew 5%. What happened to real per-capita healthcare spending?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "It increased by 10%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It increased by about 2%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "It decreased by about 3%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "It stayed the same", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Nominal increase: 10%. Real increase: 10% - 8% = 2%. Per capita change: 2% - 5% = -3%. Despite the headline '10% increase', real per-capita spending actually decreased by about 3% because inflation and population growth outpaced the budget increase."

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed the Decoding Budgets curriculum, you can:

1. **Analyze your own municipality** using the template above
2. **Explore Transparenta.eu** to find data for any entity
3. **Compare entities** using benchmarking techniques
4. **Track budget changes** over the year with rectifications
5. **Share insights** with your community

---

## Key Takeaway

> Budget analysis is systematic, not mystical. By following a consistent process - find data, apply classifications, normalize comparisons, check context, form conclusions - you can analyze any public budget and contribute to democratic accountability.

**Congratulations on completing the Decoding Budgets curriculum!**
