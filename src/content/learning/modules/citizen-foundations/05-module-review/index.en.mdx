## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="foundations-review-q1"
  question="What percentage of an average Romanian employee's gross salary goes to public budgets through taxes and contributions?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "About 10%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "About 25%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "About 41.5%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "About 60%", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Around 41.5% of a gross salary goes to public budgets: 10% income tax, 25% social insurance (CAS), 10% health insurance (CASS), plus the employer's share. This is why budget oversight matters—it's a significant portion of your earnings."

<Quiz
  id="foundations-review-q2"
  question="Which of your three citizen roles requires NO money to exercise and is often the most underused?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Taxpayer", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Beneficiary", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Watchdog", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Voter", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The Watchdog role costs nothing—Law 544/2001 gives you the right to request any public information for free. Yet most citizens never use it. The Taxpayer role is mandatory, and Beneficiary is passive. Watchdog is the active, empowering role most people ignore."
/>

<Quiz
  id="foundations-review-q3"
  question="You see that a municipality executed 97% of its personnel budget but only 42% of its investment budget. What pattern does this reveal?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The municipality is saving money responsibly", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Salaries are prioritized while infrastructure is delayed", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "There are no investment needs in this municipality", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "The data must be incorrect", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This is the classic 'promises vs reality' pattern from Lesson 3: personnel costs (mandatory, politically sensitive) get paid first, while capital investments (construction, equipment) can be delayed to 'next year.' The 42% execution means less than half of planned investments happened."
/>

<Quiz
  id="foundations-review-q4"
  question="Romania's public budget is approximately 727 billion RON annually. What is the largest spending category?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Defense and National Security", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Social Protection (primarily pensions)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Healthcare", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Social Protection (~32% of the budget) is by far the largest category, primarily funding pensions for approximately 4.7 million retirees. It's larger than Health and Education combined. This makes pension policy one of the most significant budget decisions each year."
/>

<Quiz
  id="foundations-review-q5"
  question="What legal right guarantees your access to public budget information in Romania?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Constitution Article 31", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Law 544/2001 on free access to public information", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "EU Freedom of Information Act", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "There is no such legal right", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Law 544/2001 is Romania's FOIA (Freedom of Information Act). It guarantees every citizen the right to request public information within 10 days (standard) or 30 days (complex requests). This is your key tool as a watchdog citizen."
/>

<Quiz
  id="foundations-review-q6"
  question="The Budget Explorer treemap shows boxes of different sizes. What does a larger box indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Higher priority according to government policy", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Greater total spending in that category", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "More citizens affected by that category", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Better execution rate for that category", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="In a treemap visualization, box size represents spending amount—larger boxes mean more money. This lets you quickly see relative spending across categories at a glance. Priority, citizens affected, and execution rate are separate dimensions not shown by box size."
