# Your Three Roles

## Concept Introduction

You don't have just one relationship with public budgets — you have three. Most people only think of themselves as taxpayers (the money going out), but you're equally a beneficiary (services coming in) and a watchdog (your democratic right to oversight).

Understanding all three roles empowers you to engage more meaningfully with how public money is managed.

> **Key Insight:** Every citizen simultaneously pays into the system, benefits from it, and has the legal right to scrutinize how it operates.

## Core Explanation

### Role 1: Taxpayer 💰

Every purchase you make includes VAT (21% standard rate since August 2025). Every paycheck has income tax and social contributions deducted. In total, the average Romanian worker contributes roughly 41.5% of their gross salary to the state: 25% pension (CAS), 10% health insurance (CASS), and 10% income tax applied to the remaining 65% taxable base (effectively 6.5% of gross).

This money funds everything from your local road repairs to national defense.

### Role 2: Beneficiary 📋

Don't just think about what you pay — think about what you receive:

| Service | Annual Value (approx.) |
|---------|------------------------|
| Transport infrastructure | ~1,500 RON |
| Public healthcare | ~4,500 RON |
| Education (per child) | ~16,000 RON |
| Security services | ~1,500 RON |

Most citizens receive more in services than they pay in taxes — that's how progressive taxation and public goods work.

### Role 3: Watchdog 👁️

This might be your most important role. **Law 544/2001** (Legea privind liberul acces la informațiile de interes public) guarantees your right to request any public information from any public institution.

You can ask:
- How much was spent on a specific project?
- Who won a public contract and why?
- What's the salary structure in a public institution?

Transparenta.eu makes exercising this role easier by pre-analyzing public budget data.

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** You are simultaneously a taxpayer (funding the system), a beneficiary (using public services), and a watchdog (with legal rights to oversight). The watchdog role — guaranteed by Law 544/2001 — is what makes the other two roles accountable.
