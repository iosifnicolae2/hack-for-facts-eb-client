# Taxpayer, Beneficiary, Watchdog

You're not just a taxpayer. In fact, your most powerful role costs you nothing—and most people don't even know they have it.

Every citizen has three distinct relationships with public budgets. Most only think about the first one. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand all three—and know exactly which law protects your right to use the most important one.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:** Describe your three budget-related roles and identify the Romanian law that protects your oversight rights.

## Quick Recall

<Hidden trigger="From Lesson 1: What is the 'social contract' in public budgets?">
The social contract is the exchange where you contribute taxes, the government allocates that money to priorities, and you receive public services in return. The budget document makes this contract visible.
</Hidden>

Now let's look at your specific roles in this contract.

## Role 1: Taxpayer 💰

Every purchase you make includes VAT (21% standard rate since August 2025). Every paycheck has income tax and social contributions deducted.

For a 5,000 RON gross salary:
- **1,250 RON** → Pension fund (CAS - 25%)
- **500 RON** → Health insurance (CASS - 10%)
- **325 RON** → Income tax (10% of taxable base)
- **Total: ~2,075 RON** (about 41.5% of gross)

This money funds everything from your local road repairs to national defense.

<Hidden trigger="Quick check: What are the three main ways you contribute as a taxpayer?">
1. **Income tax** (10% of taxable income)
2. **Social contributions** (CAS 25% + CASS 10%)
3. **VAT** (21% on most purchases)
</Hidden>

## Role 2: Beneficiary 📋

Don't just think about what you pay—think about what you receive:

| Service | Annual Value per Person (approx.) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Transport infrastructure | ~1,500 RON |
| Public healthcare | ~4,500 RON |
| Education (per child) | ~16,000 RON |
| Security services | ~1,500 RON |

**Here's what surprises most people:** The average citizen receives more in services than they pay in taxes. That's how progressive taxation and public goods work—those who earn more contribute more, and essential services reach everyone.

## Role 3: Watchdog 👁️

This might be your most important role—and it's free to use.

**Law 544/2001** (*Legea privind liberul acces la informațiile de interes public*) guarantees your right to request any public information from any public institution.

You can ask:
- How much was spent on a specific project?
- Who won a public contract and why?
- What's the salary structure in a public institution?
- Why was a budget line underspent?

Institutions must respond within 10 working days (or 30 days for complex requests).

**Transparenta.eu makes exercising this role easier** by pre-analyzing public budget data—so you can spot patterns first, then ask targeted questions.

## Check Your Understanding

<Quiz
  id="watchdog-role-application"
  question="Ana noticed that her city's park renovation cost 2 million RON, but the park looks unchanged. Which role should she use, and what should she do?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Taxpayer role: Stop paying local taxes until the park is fixed", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Beneficiary role: Organize neighbors to demand better services", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Watchdog role: Submit a Law 544/2001 request for detailed spending records", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "None: Citizens can't access budget information for specific projects", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Ana should use her watchdog role. Law 544/2001 gives her the legal right to request detailed records of how the 2 million RON was spent—including contracts, invoices, and work completion reports. This is more effective than organizing protests (beneficiary) or refusing taxes (illegal). Option D is factually wrong—citizens absolutely can access this information."

## Key Takeaway

> You are simultaneously a **taxpayer** (funding the system with ~41.5% of your salary), a **beneficiary** (receiving public services), and a **watchdog** (with legal rights to oversight). The watchdog role—guaranteed by **Law 544/2001**—is what makes the other two roles accountable.

**Most citizens only know their taxpayer role.** Now you know all three. In the next lesson, you'll see exactly where your tax money flows—from your paycheck to public services.
