# Your First Investigation

Somewhere in the Budget Explorer, there's a number that will surprise you. In the next 5 minutes, you're going to find it.

Knowledge without action is incomplete. You now understand what public budgets are, your three roles as a citizen, and how money flows from paychecks to services. It's time to put this knowledge into practice.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:** Navigate the Budget Explorer and find spending data for any category.

## Quick Recall

<ExpandableHint trigger="From Lesson 3: What's Romania's largest spending category?">
**Social Protection** (~32%)—primarily pensions for approximately 4.7 million retirees. It's larger than Health and Education combined.

You're about to verify this for yourself.

## What You'll Find in Budget Explorer

The Budget Explorer presents budget data in several views:

| View | What It Shows | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Treemap** | Boxes sized by spending amount | Seeing relative sizes at a glance |
| **Bar Chart** | Horizontal bars for comparison | Comparing specific categories |
| **Time Series** | Spending over years | Tracking trends and changes |
| **Per Capita** | Spending divided by population | Fair comparisons across entities |

### Quick Navigation Tips

1. **Drill Down** — Click any category to see its subcategories
2. **Change Year** — Use the year selector to compare different periods
3. **Switch Entity** — View national, local, or specific institution budgets
4. **Export Data** — Download the data for your own analysis

## Your First Challenge

Now test your navigation skills with a hands-on challenge:

<ExpandableHint trigger="Challenge: Find the smallest main spending category in the national budget">
Open the Budget Explorer and look at the treemap. The smallest boxes represent the smallest spending categories. You should find **Recreation, Culture and Religion** or **Environmental Protection** among the smallest—typically around 1-2% of the budget.

## Check Your Understanding

<Quiz
  id="platform-navigation-application"
  question="You find that a city's healthcare budget shows 60% execution while education shows 95%. Based on what you learned in Lesson 3, what does this suggest and what would be your next step as a watchdog citizen?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Both are acceptable—move on to other categories", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Healthcare has a significant gap—use Law 544/2001 to request detailed spending records", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Education is overspending—investigate why they used 95%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "The numbers are probably wrong—ignore the data", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="A 60% healthcare execution rate means 40% of planned spending didn't happen—a significant gap that could affect patient care. As a watchdog (Lesson 2), you can use Law 544/2001 to request detailed records. Education at 95% is actually good execution—some underspending is normal due to savings or timing. Option C misunderstands that 95% isn't overspending. Option D dismisses valid data without investigation."
