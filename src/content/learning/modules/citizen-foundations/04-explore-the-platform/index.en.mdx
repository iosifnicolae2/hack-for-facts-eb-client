# Explore the Platform

## Concept Introduction

Knowledge without action is incomplete. Now that you understand what public budgets are, your three roles as a citizen, and how to spot the gap between promises and reality, it's time to put this knowledge into practice.

Transparenta.eu's Budget Explorer is your tool for investigating public spending. In this lesson, you'll take a guided tour and complete a hands-on task.

> **Key Insight:** The Budget Explorer transforms abstract budget numbers into interactive visualizations you can explore, filter, and understand.

## Interactive Element: Guided Platform Tour

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  YOUR FIRST EXPLORATION                                       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                              |
|  Follow these 4 steps to explore public spending:            |
|                                                              |
|  Step 1: Click the button below to open Budget Explorer      |
|          [ Open Budget Explorer -> ]                          |
|          Status: [ ] Opened                                  |
|                                                              |
|  Step 2: Look at the treemap - each box represents a         |
|          spending category. Bigger box = more money.         |
|          Status: [ ] Understood                              |
|                                                              |
|  Step 3: Click on "Social Protection" (usually the biggest)  |
|          See what's inside: pensions, welfare, etc.          |
|          Status: [ ] Explored                                |
|                                                              |
|  Step 4: Try switching to "Per Capita" view                  |
|          Now you see spending per person, not totals.        |
|          Status: [ ] Switched                                |
|                                                              |
|  Progress: [====              ] 0/4 steps completed          |
|                                                              |

  readonly budgetExplorerUrl: string
  readonly onComplete: () => void
}

interface TourStep {
  readonly id: string
  readonly instruction: string
  readonly hint?: string
  readonly validation: 'manual' | 'auto'
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:

## Core Explanation

### What You'll Find in Budget Explorer

The Budget Explorer presents budget data in several views:

| View | What It Shows | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Treemap** | Boxes sized by spending amount | Seeing relative sizes at a glance |
| **Bar Chart** | Horizontal bars for comparison | Comparing specific categories |
| **Time Series** | Spending over years | Tracking trends and changes |
| **Per Capita** | Spending divided by population | Fair comparisons across entities |

### Quick Navigation Tips

1. **Drill Down** - Click any category to see its subcategories
2. **Change Year** - Use the year selector to compare different periods
3. **Switch Entity** - View national, local, or specific institution budgets
4. **Export Data** - Download the data for your own analysis

## Practice: Find the Smallest Category

Now test your navigation skills with a hands-on challenge:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  CHALLENGE: Find the Smallest Spending Category              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                              |
|  Using the Budget Explorer, find which main category gets    |
|  the LEAST amount of money in the national budget.           |
|                                                              |
|  Your answer: [ _________________ ]                          |
|                                                              |
|  Hint: Look at the treemap - the smallest boxes are the      |
|  categories with the least spending.                         |
|                                                              |
