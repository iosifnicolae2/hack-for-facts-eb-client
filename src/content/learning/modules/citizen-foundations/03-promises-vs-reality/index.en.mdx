# Promises vs Reality

## Concept Introduction

Politicians make promises. Budgets are planned. But what actually happens? The gap between what was **planned** and what was **spent** reveals the true priorities of any government — not their words, but their actions.

This gap is measured by the **execution rate**: the percentage of planned budget that was actually spent. An execution rate of 100% means everything planned was spent. Below 70%? That's a significant gap worth investigating.

> **Key Insight:** The budget reveals what a society truly values — not what politicians say, but where they actually put the money.

### Component Specification

```typescript
interface PromiseTrackerProps {
  readonly years: ReadonlyArray<number>
  readonly defaultYear: number
  readonly data: {
    [year: number]: {
      overall: { planned: number; executed: number }
      breakdown: ReadonlyArray<{
        category: string
        planned: number
        executed: number
        executionRate: number
      }>
    }
  }
  readonly onExploreClick: (year: number, category?: string) => void
}

interface PromiseTrackerState {
  selectedYear: number
  hoveredCategory: string | null
  animationComplete: boolean
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Year tabs switch data display with smooth transition (200ms fade)
- Progress bars animate on load (1s duration, staggered by 100ms)
- Color coding: green (&gt;90%), yellow (70-90%), red (&lt;70%)
- Hover on category bar shows tooltip with exact figures
- "Explore in Budget Explorer" opens filtered view for selected year
- Key Finding updates based on data patterns

**Accessibility:**
- Progress bars use `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow`
- Color is not the only indicator (also icons: ✓, ⚠, ✗)
- Keyboard navigation between year tabs

## Core Explanation

### Understanding Execution Rates

| Execution Rate | Meaning | Signal |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| 95-100% | Budget fully utilized | Normal operation |
| 70-95% | Moderate underspending | Minor delays or savings |
| 50-70% | Significant gap | Planning issues or blocked projects |
| Below 50% | Major failure | Investigate: Why wasn't money spent? |

### Why Does Underspending Happen?

Not all underspending is bad, but patterns matter:

1. **Bureaucratic delays** — Procurement takes longer than planned
2. **Poor planning** — Budgets set unrealistically high
3. **Capacity issues** — Institutions can't absorb funds fast enough
4. **Political priorities** — Funds quietly redirected or frozen
5. **External factors** — EU project conditions not met

### The Personnel vs Investment Pattern

One pattern repeats every year in Romania: **personnel costs execute at 95-100%** while **capital investments execute at 50-70%**.

This means salaries always get paid, but the new school, the hospital wing, the road repair? Often delayed to next year. And next year. And the year after.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="execution-rate-quiz"
  question="A ministry planned to spend 10 billion RON but only spent 6 billion RON. What is the execution rate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "40%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "60%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "160%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Cannot be calculated", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Execution rate = (Actual Spent / Planned) × 100. In this case: (6 billion / 10 billion) × 100 = 60%. This is a significant gap that would warrant investigation into why 40% of planned spending didn't happen."
/>

<Quiz
  id="pattern-recognition-quiz"
  question="In Romania, which type of spending typically has the LOWEST execution rate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Personnel costs (salaries)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Goods and services", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Capital investments (infrastructure)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Social transfers (pensions)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Capital investments consistently have the lowest execution rates (often 50-70%), meaning infrastructure projects — schools, hospitals, roads — frequently get delayed. Personnel costs, by contrast, execute near 100% because salaries must be paid."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** The gap between planned and spent reveals the truth. Watch execution rates — especially the pattern where salaries execute at 98% while infrastructure lingers at 58%. That gap is where unkept promises live.
