# Your Invisible Budget

What if I told you that right now, as you read this, approximately €50 of public money is being spent every second in Romania? And that you've already interacted with at least five budget-funded services today—without even noticing?

Public budgets are invisible. Yet they shape everything from the water in your morning coffee to the roads you travel, the schools your children attend, and the hospitals you hope never to need.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:** Explain what a public budget is and why it matters to you personally.

## Before We Begin

Think about how you manage money at home. You have income (your salary), and you decide how to spend it: rent, food, utilities, savings. Some months you spend more on one thing, less on another. You make trade-offs.

<ExpandableHint trigger="Quick question: What limits your spending choices at home?">
Your income. You can't spend more than you have—at least not for long. This same principle applies to governments, though they have more tools (like borrowing) to manage timing.
</ExpandableHint>

This intuition will help you understand public budgets.

## The Household Analogy

A public budget works like your household budget—but at national scale:

| Your Home | Romania's Budget |
|-----------|------------------|
| Your salary | Tax revenue (~43% of GDP) |
| Rent, food, utilities | Social protection, health, education |
| Savings for emergencies | Reserves and debt management |
| You decide spending | Parliament approves, Government executes |

The key difference? **It's YOUR money they're spending.** Every leu in the public budget comes from citizens—through income taxes, VAT on purchases, and social contributions.

<ExpandableHint trigger="Guess: What percentage of Romania's GDP flows through public budgets?">
**About 43%.** That means for every 100 lei of economic activity in Romania, 43 lei pass through government hands. This makes budget oversight critically important.

## Your Invisible Budget Day

Most people think they only interact with budgets when they pay taxes. The truth? **You're surrounded by budget-funded services right now**—you just don't see them.

The interactive revealer below shows your daily "budget footprint"—all the publicly funded services you've already used today without even noticing. Click through to discover how budget categories connect to your morning routine:

<BudgetFootprintRevealer budgetExplorerUrl="/budget-explorer" />

Did you spot the pattern? Almost everything in your day connects to public spending: the water infrastructure (Housing & Community), the roads (Transport), the electricity grid regulations (Economic Affairs), and more. This is why budget oversight matters—it affects services you depend on every day.

## The Social Contract

When you pay taxes, you enter a social contract with the government:

1. **You contribute** through income tax, VAT, and social contributions (~41.5% of an average gross salary)
2. **The government allocates** this money across priorities: pensions, healthcare, education, defense
3. **You receive** public services: roads, hospitals, schools, security

The budget document is where this contract becomes visible. It shows exactly how much goes where—and whether promises match reality.

### Romania's Budget at a Glance

- **Total size:** ~727 billion RON annually (2024)
- **Largest category:** Social protection (pensions for ~4.7 million retirees)
- **Who decides:** Parliament approves, Government executes
- **Your right:** Law 544/2001 guarantees access to this information

## Check Your Understanding

<Quiz
  id="budget-analogy-application"
  question="Maria wants to explain public budgets to her elderly grandmother who never finished school. Which approach would help her grandmother understand best?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Show her the official budget law document from Parliament", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Compare it to how grandmother manages her pension each month", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Explain the economic theory behind fiscal policy", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Quote the exact percentages for each budget category", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The household analogy works because everyone—regardless of education—understands managing limited money. Just as grandmother decides how much of her pension goes to food versus medicine, the government decides how tax money is divided among services. The other options are too technical or abstract."

## Key Takeaway

> A public budget is your household budget at national scale. About 43% of Romania's GDP—roughly 727 billion RON—flows through government hands each year. Since it's YOUR money, you have both the right and the reason to understand where it goes.

**The invisible becomes visible** when you start looking. In the next lesson, you'll discover that you're not just a taxpayer—you have two other roles that most citizens never exercise.
