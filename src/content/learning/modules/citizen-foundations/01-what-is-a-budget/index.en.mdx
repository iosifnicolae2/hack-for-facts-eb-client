# What is a Public Budget?

## Concept Introduction

Think of a public budget like your household budget, but for an entire country. Just like you decide how much to spend on rent, food, and savings, the government decides how much to spend on schools, hospitals, and roads.

The key difference? **It's YOUR money they're spending.** Every lei in the public budget comes from citizens — through income taxes, VAT on purchases, and social contributions. In Romania, approximately 43% of GDP flows through public budgets each year.

> **Key Insight:** Understanding the public budget isn't just about numbers — it's about knowing where your money goes and whether it's being spent wisely.

## Core Explanation

### The Social Contract

When you pay taxes, you're entering a social contract with the government:

1. **You contribute** through income tax, VAT, and social contributions (roughly 35% of an average salary)
2. **The government allocates** this money across priorities: defense, healthcare, education, infrastructure
3. **You receive** public services: roads, hospitals, schools, security

The budget document is where this contract becomes visible. It shows exactly how much goes where, and whether promises match reality.
