# Decoding Budget Lines

## Concept Introduction

Now that you know functional (what for?) and economic (what type?) classifications, it's time to put them together. Real budget lines combine BOTH systems, creating codes like `65.02.04.01 - 71.01.01`.

At first glance, this looks like encrypted gibberish. But with your new knowledge, you can decode it instantly.

> **Key Insight:** Once you can decode a budget line, budget documents become readable maps instead of intimidating spreadsheets.

## Try the Classification Explorer

Put your new knowledge into practice! Use our Classification Explorer to search and browse through budget codes:

**[Explore Functional Classifications →](/classifications/functional)**
Search by code or name to find what each functional code means (Education, Health, Defense, etc.)

**[Explore Economic Classifications →](/classifications/economic)**
Browse economic codes to understand spending types (Personnel, Investments, Transfers, etc.)

> **Try this:** Search for code "65" in the Functional Explorer to see Education and all its subcategories. Then search for "71" in the Economic Explorer to find Capital Investments.

## Core Explanation

### Reading a Real Budget Document

Let's decode a real budget excerpt:

**Cluj-Napoca Local Budget 2024 — Education (65.02)**

| Code | Description | Planned | Actual (%) |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 65.02 | EDUCATION | 450,000 | 385,000 (86%) |
| 10 | Personnel costs | 280,000 | 275,000 (98%) |
| 20 | Goods & services | 90,000 | 78,000 (87%) |
| 71 | Capital investments | 80,000 | 32,000 (40%) ⚠️ |

**Reading this:**
- **65.02** = Education, local budget level (functional)
- **10** = Personnel costs (economic) → 98% execution ✓
- **20** = Goods & services (economic) → 87% execution ~
- **71** = Capital investments (economic) → 40% execution ⚠️

**The story:** This municipality paid teacher salaries (10) and kept schools running (20), but only delivered 40% of planned construction/equipment investments (71). Renovations or equipment purchases were severely delayed.

### Quick Reference Card

Based on **OMFP nr. 1954/2005** (Order of the Minister of Public Finance), Romanian budget classifications are organized into five parts:

**Functional Classifications (What is it for?)**

| Part | Code | Category |
|------|------|----------|
| I. General Public Services | 51 | Public authorities |
| | 54 | Other general services |
| | 55 | Public debt transactions |
| | 56 | General transfers |
| II. Defense & Public Order | 60 | Defense |
| | 61 | Public order & security |
| III. Social-Cultural | 65 | Education |
| | 66 | Health |
| | 67 | Culture & religion |
| | 68 | Social protection |
| IV. Housing & Environment | 70 | Housing & public development |
| | 74 | Environment protection |
| V. Economic Actions | 80-87 | Economic affairs |

**Economic Classifications (What type of expense?)**

| Code | Type |
|------|------|
| 10 | Personnel |
| 20 | Goods & services |
| 30 | Interest |
| 40 | Subsidies |
| 50 | Transfers |
| 70 | Capital expenses |
| 71 | **Investments** ⚠️ |
| 79 | Financial operations |
| 80 | Debt service |

**Capital Code Distinction:**
- **71.01** = Acquisition of NEW fixed assets
- **71.03** = Major repairs to EXISTING assets

**Budget Level Suffixes:**
- `.01` = Central/state budget
- `.02` = Local budget
- `.03` = Social insurance
- `.05` = Health insurance

## Platform Integration: Guided Activity

Try decoding budget lines on the actual platform:

**Step 1:** Open the [Classification Explorer](/classifications/functional)

**Step 2:** Find code "66" — what function is it? *(Hint: It's critical for everyone)*

**Step 3:** Expand "66.02" and look for "66.02.06" — what specific health service is this?
*(Answer: Servicii medicale în unități sanitare cu paturi — Inpatient medical services / hospitals)*

**Step 4:** Open the [Economic Classification Explorer](/classifications/economic)

**Step 5:** Find code "71" and its subcategories. What's the difference between 71.01 and 71.03?

> **Critical distinction:**
> - **71.01** (Active fixe) = Acquisition of **NEW** fixed assets — new construction, new machinery, new equipment
> - **71.03** (Reparații capitale) = Major repairs to **EXISTING** assets — renovations, rehabilitation of infrastructure
>
> This matters for budget analysis: 71.01 means expansion, 71.03 means maintenance of current capacity.

**Bonus Challenge:** What does the full code "66.02.06 - 71.01.02" mean?
*(Answer: Medical equipment purchase for local hospitals — 66.02.06 is inpatient services, 71.01.02 is machinery/equipment/transport)*

  question="What does the budget code '65.02.04.01 - 71.01.01' mean in plain language?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Teacher salaries at secondary schools", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Construction for lower secondary education (local budget)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "University research equipment purchases", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Health services at local clinics", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="65.02.04.01 is Secondary Education (lower cycle), local budget level. 71.01.01 is Construction (capital investments). Together: 'Construction for middle schools (grades 5-8), funded from local budget.'"
/>

<Quiz
  id="decode-budget-line-q2"
  question="Looking at this budget line: '66.02 - Personnel 98%, Investments 45%' — what's the story?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Healthcare is overfunded", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Medical staff are underpaid", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Hospital staff paid, but new equipment/buildings delayed", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "The data is unreliable", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="66.02 is Health (local level). Personnel at 98% means salaries were paid. Investments at 45% means less than half of planned construction or equipment purchases happened. This is the classic pattern: operations continue, but infrastructure improvements get delayed."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Budget codes combine functional (purpose) and economic (type). When you see low execution on code 71, that's infrastructure not being built. Use the Classification Explorer to decode any code you encounter — and watch for the personnel vs. investment pattern.
