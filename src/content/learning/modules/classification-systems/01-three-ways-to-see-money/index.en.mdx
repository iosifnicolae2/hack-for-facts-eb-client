# Three Ways to See Money

## Concept Introduction

Budget documents look intimidating because they're full of numbers and codes. But once you crack the system, they become readable — and powerful.

Every single expense in the public budget can be viewed through **three lenses**. Think of it like describing a person: you could say what department they work for (organizational), what their job is about (functional), or how they're paid (economic).

> **Key Insight:** Every budget line answers three questions: WHO spends it, WHAT is it FOR, and WHAT TYPE of expense is it.

### ThreeLensesExplorer Component

```typescript
/**
 * ThreeLensesExplorer Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Visualize how the same expense can be viewed through three different
 * classification systems, building intuition for budget document structure.
 */
interface ThreeLensesExplorerProps {
  readonly examples: ReadonlyArray<BudgetExample>
  readonly onLensClick?: (lens: 'organizational' | 'functional' | 'economic') => void
}

interface BudgetExample {
  readonly id: string
  readonly amount: number
  readonly description: string
  readonly organizational: {
    readonly entity: string
    readonly code?: string
  }
  readonly functional: {
    readonly category: string
    readonly code: string
    readonly subcategory?: string
  }
  readonly economic: {
    readonly type: string
    readonly code: string
    readonly subtype?: string
  }
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - activeLens: 'all' | 'organizational' | 'functional' | 'economic'
 * - currentExample: number (index of selected example)
 * - isAnimating: boolean
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Click on lens card → highlight that lens, dim others
 * - Click "Show All" → return to balanced view
 * - Swipe/click arrows → change example
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click on any lens card to focus on it
 * - Click example arrows to see different budget items
 * - Hover on code to see tooltip with full name
 * - Keyboard: Arrow Left/Right to navigate examples, 1/2/3 to select lens
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: Three equal cards with subtle borders
 * - Focused: Selected card scales up (1.05), others fade (opacity 0.6)
 * - Hovering: Subtle shadow elevation
 * - Animating: Smooth transitions between states (300ms ease-out)
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Card focus: scale + elevation (300ms)
 * - Example change: crossfade (200ms)
 * - Initial load: stagger cards from left to right (100ms delay each)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="radiogroup" for lens selection
 * - Each card is role="radio" with aria-checked
 * - Example navigation has aria-label with example description
 * - Screen reader announces selected lens and example details
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Three cards represent the three lenses
- Users can click each lens to focus on it
- Example section shows how a real expense maps to all three
- Each code is clickable to see its full name
- "Learn More" buttons lead to next lessons (Functional, Economic)

## Core Explanation

### Why Three Systems?

Each classification system serves a different purpose:

| System | Question | Purpose | Example Code |
|--------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Organizational** | WHO spends? | Accountability — trace money to responsible entity | Ministry of Health |
| **Functional** | WHAT FOR? | Purpose — understand policy priorities | 66 (Health) |
| **Economic** | WHAT TYPE? | Nature — distinguish salaries from investments | 10 (Personnel) |

### How They Work Together

When you see a budget line like `65.02.04.01 - 71.01.01`, you're seeing:

- **65.02.04.01** = Functional classification (Education → Local level → Secondary → Lower cycle)
- **71.01.01** = Economic classification (Capital investments → Fixed assets → Construction)

Together they tell you: "Construction for a middle school, funded from local budget."

### Think of It Like…

> **Map Analogy:** Imagine describing a trip. You can say WHERE you're going (functional), HOW you're getting there (economic), or WHO is arranging it (organizational). All three describe the same trip from different angles.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="classification-systems-q1"
  question="Which classification system answers the question 'What is this money being spent ON?'"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Organizational classification", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Functional classification", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Economic classification", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Temporal classification", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Functional classification answers 'What for?' — it tells you the PURPOSE of the spending, like Education (65), Health (66), or Defense (51). This is based on the international COFOG standard."
/>

<Quiz
  id="classification-systems-q2"
  question="If you want to know whether money was spent on salaries vs building construction, which classification would you check?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Organizational — it shows who gets paid", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Functional — it shows the function of payments", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Economic — it shows the type of expense", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "None of these — you need the actual document", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Economic classification tells you the TYPE of expense: code 10 is Personnel (salaries), code 71 is Capital investments (construction). This helps identify whether money went to operations or long-term investments."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Every budget expense can be viewed through three lenses: WHO spends it (organizational), WHAT it's FOR (functional), and WHAT TYPE of expense (economic). Master these three perspectives and budget documents become readable maps.
