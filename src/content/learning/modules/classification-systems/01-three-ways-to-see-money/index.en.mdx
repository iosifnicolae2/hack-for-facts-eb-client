# Three Ways to See Money

## Concept Introduction

Budget documents look intimidating because they're full of numbers and codes. But once you crack the system, they become readable — and powerful.

In the Expenditure module, you learned about two ways to view spending: **Functional** (what for?) and **Economic** (what type?). Now we'll expand that foundation by adding a third lens — **Organizational** — and show you how to decode the full classification codes that appear in real budget documents.

Every single expense in the public budget can be viewed through **three lenses**. Think of it like describing a person: you could say what department they work for (organizational), what their job is about (functional), or how they're paid (economic).

> **Key Insight:** Every budget line answers three questions: WHO spends it, WHAT is it FOR, and WHAT TYPE of expense is it.

## Core Explanation

### Why Three Systems?

Each classification system serves a different purpose:

| System | Question | Purpose | Example Code |
|--------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Organizational** | WHO spends? | Accountability — trace money to responsible entity | Ministry of Health |
| **Functional** | WHAT FOR? | Purpose — understand policy priorities | 66 (Health)* |
| **Economic** | WHAT TYPE? | Nature — distinguish salaries from investments | 10 (Personnel) |

> *Note: Romania uses its own national classification codes (established by Order MFP 1954/2005), which differ from the international COFOG standard. For example, Romanian code 66 = Health maps to COFOG 07, and Romanian code 65 = Education maps to COFOG 09.

### How They Work Together

When you see a budget line like `65.02.04.01 - 71.01.01`, you're seeing:

- **65.02.04.01** = Functional classification (Education → Local level → Secondary → Lower cycle)
- **71.01.01** = Economic classification (Capital investments → Fixed assets → Construction)

Together they tell you: "Construction for a middle school, funded from local budget."

### Think of It Like…

> **Map Analogy:** Imagine describing a trip. You can say WHERE you're going (functional), HOW you're getting there (economic), or WHO is arranging it (organizational). All three describe the same trip from different angles.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="classification-systems-q1"
  question="Which classification system answers the question 'What is this money being spent ON?'"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Organizational classification", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Functional classification", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Economic classification", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Temporal classification", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Functional classification answers 'What for?' — it tells you the PURPOSE of the spending. Romania uses its own national codes (65 for Education, 66 for Health, 60 for Defense) which map to but differ from the international COFOG standard (COFOG uses 09 for Education, 07 for Health, 02 for Defense)."
/>

<Quiz
  id="classification-systems-q2"
  question="If you want to know whether money was spent on salaries vs building construction, which classification would you check?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Organizational — it shows who gets paid", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Functional — it shows the function of payments", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Economic — it shows the type of expense", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "None of these — you need the actual document", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Economic classification tells you the TYPE of expense: code 10 is Personnel (salaries), code 71 is Capital investments (construction). This helps identify whether money went to operations or long-term investments."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Every budget expense can be viewed through three lenses: WHO spends it (organizational), WHAT it's FOR (functional), and WHAT TYPE of expense (economic). Master these three perspectives and budget documents become readable maps.
