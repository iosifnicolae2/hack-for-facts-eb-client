# Investigating with Classifications

## Quick Recall

<ExpandableHint trigger="What are the three classification lenses?">

1. **Functional** (What is it for?) — Education (65), Health (66), etc.
2. **Economic** (What type of expense?) — Personnel (10), Investments (71), etc.
3. **Organizational** (Who controls it?) — .01 state budget, .02 local budget

These three lenses let you decode any budget line. Now we'll use them to **investigate** problems, not just read budgets.

</ExpandableHint>

## You Found a Red Flag. Now What?

Spotting a budget problem is just the beginning. The real skill is **investigating** what's behind it.

When the Red Flags module teaches you to look for low investment execution or unusual spending patterns, your classification knowledge becomes the investigative tool. Without it, you know *something* is wrong — with it, you know *what specifically* failed and *where to dig deeper*.

> **Key Insight:** Classifications are your microscope. Red flags tell you where to look; classifications show you what you're seeing.

## Investigation Method: The Drill-Down

When you spot a red flag, use classifications to drill down from general to specific:

```
RED FLAG DETECTED
       ↓
FUNCTIONAL: What purpose failed?
       ↓
ECONOMIC: What type of spending failed?
       ↓
SUB-CODES: Which specific activities failed?
       ↓
ROOT CAUSE: Now you have the right question
```

### Investigation Example 1: Low Investment Execution

**Red Flag:** A city has only 45% execution on capital investments (Code 71).

**Without classification knowledge:** "They didn't spend investment money." *(vague, no direction)*

**With classification knowledge:**

**Step 1 — Drill into Economic Sub-codes:**
| Sub-code | Name | Execution | Signal |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| 71.01.01 | Construction | 38% | Major issue |
| 71.01.02 | Equipment | 62% | Moderate |
| 71.01.03 | Vehicles | 95% | Fine |
| 71.03 | Major Repairs | 28% | Critical |

**Step 2 — Drill into Functional Classifications:**
| Function | Code 71 Execution | Meaning |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Education (65.02) | 32% | School construction stalled |
| Health (66.02) | 41% | Hospital equipment delayed |
| Housing (70.02) | 55% | Some housing projects progressed |

**Step 3 — Formulate Targeted Questions:**
- "Why did school construction (65.02 + 71.01.01) achieve only 32% execution?"
- "Were procurement procedures blocked? Land issues? Contractor problems?"
- "What specific schools were planned but not built?"

**Result:** Instead of asking "why wasn't money spent?", you can ask "why wasn't the new middle school on Strada Victoriei built when 4.2 million RON was allocated?"

## Investigation Example 2: Personnel Crowding Out Investment

**Red Flag:** Personnel costs are 68% of total budget (above the 60% warning threshold).

**Step 1 — Identify which functions are affected:**

| Function | Personnel % | Investment % | Pattern |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Education (65.02) | 72% | 8% | Severe crowding |
| Health (66.02) | 64% | 12% | Moderate |
| Culture (67.02) | 45% | 35% | Balanced |
| Public Order (61.02) | 55% | 25% | Balanced |

**Step 2 — Focus on the worst case (Education):**
- Code 10 (personnel) at 72% means almost all money goes to salaries
- Code 71 (investments) at 8% means virtually no infrastructure improvements
- **What's suffering?** School renovations, new equipment, building repairs

**Step 3 — Formulate Investigation Questions:**
- "How many teaching positions were added in the last 3 years versus infrastructure investments?"
- "Which schools are in the worst physical condition, and are they receiving any capital funding?"
- "Is the high personnel percentage due to overstaffing or underfunding of total budget?"

## Cross-Referencing: The Power Move

The most powerful investigation technique combines **multiple classification perspectives**:

<ExpandableHint trigger="Investigation Scenario: The Education Budget Mystery">

**The Red Flags:**
1. Education (65.02) has 95% personnel execution but only 35% investment execution
2. Total education spending is growing 15% per year
3. Parent complaints about deteriorating school buildings

**Cross-Reference Investigation:**

| Question | Classification Path | What You Find |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Where's the money going? | 65.02 → Code 10 | Salaries growing fast |
| What's NOT happening? | 65.02 → Code 71.01 | No new construction |
| What about repairs? | 65.02 → Code 71.03 | Major repairs at 28% |
| Which schools? | 65.02.04 vs 65.02.03 | Secondary worse than primary |

**Root Cause Hypothesis:** New teaching hires are absorbing budget growth, leaving nothing for building maintenance. Secondary schools (65.02.04) are hit hardest, possibly due to enrollment-based staffing formulas.

**FOIA Question:** "Please provide the breakdown of personnel growth (number of positions and salary increases) versus capital expenditure for code 65.02 over the past 5 years."

## The Investigation Checklist

When you find a red flag, use this systematic approach:

<FlashCardDeck
  cards={[
    { front: "Step 1: Economic Drill-Down", back: "Break down the economic code (10, 20, 71) into sub-categories. Which specific type of spending is the problem?" },
    { front: "Step 2: Functional Drill-Down", back: "Check which government functions (Education 65, Health 66, etc.) are affected. Is it one sector or many?" },
    { front: "Step 3: Cross-Reference", back: "Combine functional + economic views. Example: Is low 71 execution specific to Education, or affecting all sectors?" },
    { front: "Step 4: Compare Periods", back: "Is this a new pattern or recurring? Check 2-3 years of data to spot trends." },
    { front: "Step 5: Formulate Questions", back: "Write specific questions using the codes you found. 'Why is 65.02.04 + 71.03 at 28%?' is better than 'Why low investment?'" }

## Practice: Investigate This Red Flag

A municipality shows these patterns:

| Category | Execution Rate |
|----------|---------------|
| Total Budget | 82% |
| Personnel (10) | 99% |
| Goods & Services (20) | 94% |
| Investments (71) | 41% |

Additionally:
- Health (66.02) investment execution: 22%
- Education (65.02) investment execution: 55%
- Transportation (84.02) investment execution: 38%

<Quiz
  id="investigation-q1"
  question="Based on the data above, which area should you investigate first?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Personnel spending, since it's at 99%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Health investments (66.02 + 71), since they're at only 22%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Goods & Services, since 94% shows overspending", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Total budget, since 82% is concerning", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Health investments at 22% is the most severe red flag. 99% personnel execution is normal (salaries must be paid). 94% on goods/services is fine. Health at 22% means planned hospital equipment, renovations, or expansions didn't happen — this affects citizens directly and deserves investigation."
/>

<Quiz
  id="investigation-q2"
  question="What should your FOIA request focus on, given the Health investment red flag?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "All budget data for the entire municipality", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Salary information for healthcare workers", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Breakdown of planned vs. executed investments for code 66.02, including project-level details", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Comparison with other municipalities", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Your investigation showed Health investments (66.02 + 71) at 22%. A targeted FOIA request asks for the specific projects under code 66.02 capital investments — what was planned, what was executed, and why the gap exists. General requests get general (useless) answers. Specific requests based on classification codes get actionable information."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Classifications transform vague red flags into specific investigations. When you spot a problem, drill down through economic codes (what type of spending?), functional codes (which government purpose?), and sub-codes (which specific activities?). The result: targeted questions that get real answers.

**Next:** Now that you can both detect red flags AND investigate them, you're ready to apply these skills to real data in the Capstone project.
