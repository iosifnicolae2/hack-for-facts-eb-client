# Economic Classification

In October 2022, Romania's Ministry of Finance reported a troubling statistic: only 53.7% of planned capital investments had been spent. Teacher salaries? 95%+ execution. Hospital construction? Barely half.

This pattern repeats every year. The code that exposes it is **Code 71 — Capital Investments**. Today you'll learn to spot it.

> **After this lesson, you'll be able to:**
> - Distinguish between current expenses (operations) and capital expenses (investments)
> - Identify the key economic codes: 10, 20, 51, 57, 71
> - Explain why Code 71 is the most important "red flag" in budget analysis

<ExpandableHint trigger="Quick check: What question does functional classification answer?">
**Functional classification** answers: "What is this money FOR?" (Education, Health, Defense)

**Economic classification** answers a different question: "What TYPE of expense is this?" (Salaries, Goods, Construction)

Both are needed to fully understand a budget line.

## Core Explanation

### The Big Picture: Two Types of Spending

| Type | Key Codes | Nature | Budget Behavior |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Current Expenses** | 10, 20, 30, 40, 51, 55, 57 | Day-to-day operations | High execution (85%+) |
| **Capital Expenses** | 71, 72 | Long-term investments | Low execution (50-70%) |

**Current expense codes explained:**
- **10** = Personnel, **20** = Goods & services, **30** = Interest (on debt)
- **40** = Subsidies, **51** = Inter-government transfers, **55** = Other transfers
- **57** = Social assistance (major category at local level)

### Most Important Economic Codes

**Code 10 — Personnel Costs** (Cheltuieli de personal)
- **10.01**: Cash salaries (wages, bonuses, overtime) — bonuses are at 10.01.04-10.01.06
- **10.02**: In-kind salaries (holiday vouchers, meal tickets)
- **10.03**: Employer contributions (social security, health)
- Treated as obligatory fixed costs — typically near-full execution
- If significantly under budget, may indicate unfilled positions

**Code 20 — Goods and Services** (Bunuri și servicii)
- **20.01**: Operating goods (includes utilities at 20.01.03-04)
- **20.02**: Current repairs (maintenance)
- **20.05**: Inventory items (equipment, linens, tools)
- **20.30**: Other expenses — often contains consulting contracts
- Has intermediate flexibility in budget rectifications

**Code 71 — Capital Investments** ⚠️ (Active nefinanciare)
- **71.01**: Fixed assets (buildings, equipment, vehicles)
- **71.03**: Capital repairs (large-scale rehabilitation)
- **THE RED FLAG CODE**: verified execution of only 53.7% by October 2022
- Of 140 priority investment projects tracked by the Ministry, 68 had 0% physical execution
- When this underperforms, promised infrastructure isn't being delivered

### Why Code 71 Matters Most

Every year, the pattern repeats:

<ExecutionPatternComparison
  title="Annual Execution Pattern"
  items={[
    { code: "10", name: "Personnel", rate: 95, status: "excellent", statusLabel: "Salaries paid" },
    { code: "20", name: "Goods & Services", rate: 85, status: "normal", statusLabel: "Normal" },
    { code: "71", name: "Investments", rate: 54, status: "warning", statusLabel: "RED FLAG" }
  ]}
  footnote="(verified Oct 2022)"
/>

This means: **Salaries always get paid. But the school renovation? The hospital wing? The road repair? Often delayed to next year. And the year after.**

> **2023 Reality Check:** Romania's investment target was 7.2% of GDP, but execution reached only ~3% by September. The European Commission noted Romania requires "much stricter budget execution than in the past few years."

### Code 71 Subcategories to Watch

| Code | Official Name | What to look for |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| 71.01.01 | Construcții | New buildings, major renovations |
| 71.01.02 | Mașini, echipamente și mijloace de transport | Vehicles, medical equipment, IT, computers |
| 71.01.03 | Mobilier, aparatură | Office furniture, school desks, appliances |
| 71.03 | Reparații capitale | Large-scale rehabilitation projects |

> **Note:** EU-funded projects (codes 56/58/60) constituted 61.58% of 2023 investment execution. When analyzing capital spending, always check if execution depends on EU fund absorption.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="economic-classification-q1"
  question="Economic code '71' refers to:"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Personnel costs (salaries)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Interest payments on debt", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Capital investments (construction, equipment)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Transfers to other entities", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 71 is 'Active nefinanciare' (non-financial assets) — capital investments like construction, equipment, and major repairs. This code consistently has the lowest execution rates, making it the most important to watch."
/>

<Quiz
  id="economic-classification-q2"
  question="Which economic code should you watch closely for execution rate issues?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "10 (Personnel) — it often underspends", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "20 (Goods & services) — most volatile", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "71 (Investments) — consistently lowest rates", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "51 (Transfers) — most commonly delayed", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 71 (Capital Investments) has verified execution rates as low as 53.7% (October 2022), while Personnel (10) is treated as fixed obligatory spending. When investments underperform, promised infrastructure — schools, hospitals, roads — doesn't get built."

## Key Takeaways

> **Remember:**
> - Economic classification tells you the **TYPE** of expense (not what it's for)
> - Key codes: **10** = Personnel, **20** = Goods/Services, **71** = Investments
> - **Code 71 is your RED FLAG** — verified at only ~54% execution in 2022
> - When Code 71 execution is low, promised infrastructure isn't being delivered
> - Always compare personnel vs. investment ratios to see true priorities

**Try This:** On Transparenta.eu, filter by economic code 71 for any entity. Check the execution rate. Is it above 70%? If not, which projects didn't happen?
