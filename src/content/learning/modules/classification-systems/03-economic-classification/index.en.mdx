# Economic Classification

## Concept Introduction

Economic classification answers: **"What TYPE of expense is this?"** While functional classification tells you the purpose (education, health), economic classification tells you the nature of the spending — is it salaries, utilities, or construction?

This matters enormously because it reveals whether money goes to **operations** (keeping things running) or **investments** (building for the future).

> **Key Insight:** Code 71 (Capital Investments) is the most watched code in budget analysis. It consistently has the lowest execution rates, meaning promised infrastructure often doesn't get built.

### EconomicCodeReference Component

```typescript
/**
 * EconomicCodeReference Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Interactive reference table for economic classification codes,
 * with emphasis on the Code 71 investment warning flag.
 */
interface EconomicCodeReferenceProps {
  readonly codes: ReadonlyArray<EconomicCodeCategory>
  readonly highlightCode?: string
  readonly showExecutionWarning?: boolean
  readonly onCodeClick?: (code: string) => void
}

interface EconomicCodeCategory {
  readonly code: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly nameRo: string
  readonly type: 'current' | 'capital' | 'financial'
  readonly description: string
  readonly examples: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly watchFlag?: boolean
  readonly averageExecutionRate?: number
  readonly children?: ReadonlyArray<EconomicCodeCategory>
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - expandedCodes: Set<string>
 * - hoveredCode: string | null
 * - showTooltip: boolean
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Click row → expand to show subcodes
 * - Hover code → show tooltip with full description
 * - Click warning badge → show execution rate info
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click table row to expand/collapse subcategories
 * - Hover on code for quick tooltip
 * - Click "Learn More" to navigate to related lesson
 * - Mobile: tap to expand, long-press for tooltip
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: clean table layout
 * - Expanded: subcodes visible with indentation
 * - Warning flag: pulsing ⚠️ icon for code 71
 * - Hovered: row highlight (subtle background)
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Row expand: slide-down (200ms)
 * - Warning pulse: subtle glow (2s loop)
 * - Tooltip: fade-in (150ms)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="table" with proper header markup
 * - aria-expanded for expandable rows
 * - Warning flag has aria-label explaining the warning
 * - Focus visible on all interactive elements

```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Expandable table showing code hierarchy
- Warning badge on code 71 with execution rate info
- Click to see full examples and explanation
- Link to Budget Explorer filtered by economic code

## Core Explanation

### The Big Picture: Two Types of Spending

| Type | Codes | Nature | Budget Behavior |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Current Expenses** | 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 | Day-to-day operations | High execution (90%+) |
| **Capital Expenses** | 71, 72 | Long-term investments | Low execution (50-70%) |

### Most Important Economic Codes

**Code 10 — Personnel Costs**
- Salaries, bonuses, employer contributions
- Almost ALWAYS executes at 98-100%
- If under 95%, something is very wrong (unfilled positions?)

**Code 20 — Goods and Services**
- Utilities, repairs, materials, consultancy
- Usually executes at 80-90%
- Subcategory 20.30 (other services) often hides consulting contracts

**Code 71 — Capital Investments** ⚠️
- Construction, equipment, vehicles
- THE RED FLAG CODE: often executes at only 50-70%
- When this underperforms, promised infrastructure isn't being delivered

### Why Code 71 Matters Most

Every year, the pattern repeats:

```
Personnel (10):      ██████████████████████  98%  ✓ Salaries paid
Goods & Services (20): █████████████████░░░░  85%  ~ Normal
Investments (71):    ██████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  58%  ⚠️ RED FLAG
```

This means: **Salaries always get paid. But the school renovation? The hospital wing? The road repair? Often delayed to next year. And the year after.**

### Code 71 Subcategories to Watch

| Code | Type | What to look for |
|------|------|------------------|
| 71.01.01 | Construction | New buildings, major renovations |
| 71.01.02 | Machinery/Equipment | Vehicles, medical equipment, IT |
| 71.01.03 | Furniture | Office furniture, school desks |
| 71.03 | Capital Repairs | Large-scale rehabilitation |

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="economic-classification-q1"
  question="Economic code '71' refers to:"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Personnel costs (salaries)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Interest payments on debt", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Capital investments (construction, equipment)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Transfers to other entities", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 71 is 'Active nefinanciare' (non-financial assets) — capital investments like construction, equipment, and major repairs. This code consistently has the lowest execution rates, making it the most important to watch."
/>

<Quiz
  id="economic-classification-q2"
  question="Which economic code should you watch closely for execution rate issues?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "10 (Personnel) — it often underspends", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "20 (Goods & services) — most volatile", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "71 (Investments) — consistently lowest rates", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "50 (Transfers) — most commonly delayed", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 71 (Capital Investments) consistently has the lowest execution rates (often 50-70%), while Personnel (10) executes at nearly 100%. When investments underperform, promised infrastructure — schools, hospitals, roads — doesn't get built."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Economic classification tells you the TYPE of expense. Key codes: 10=Personnel (salaries), 20=Goods & Services, 71=Investments (construction). Code 71 is your RED FLAG — if it's low, promised infrastructure isn't being delivered.
