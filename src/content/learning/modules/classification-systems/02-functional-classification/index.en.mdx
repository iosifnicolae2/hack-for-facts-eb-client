# Functional Classification

## Concept Introduction

Functional classification answers the question: **"What is this money FOR?"** It groups all spending by PURPOSE, regardless of which institution spends it or what type of expense it is.

Romania uses the international COFOG (Classification of Functions of Government) standard, which means you can compare Romanian spending on education directly with French or German spending — same codes, same meaning.

> **Key Insight:** Functional codes reveal PRIORITIES. If a government says education is important but code 65 gets only 3% of the budget, actions speak louder than words.

### ClassificationTree Component

```typescript
/**
 * ClassificationTree Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Provide an expandable, interactive hierarchy view of functional
 * or economic classification codes for exploration and learning.
 */
interface ClassificationTreeProps {
  readonly type: 'functional' | 'economic'
  readonly data: ReadonlyArray<ClassificationNode>
  readonly initialExpanded?: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly highlightCodes?: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly onNodeClick?: (node: ClassificationNode) => void
  readonly onExplorerLink?: () => void
}

interface ClassificationNode {
  readonly code: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly nameRo?: string
  readonly description?: string
  readonly children?: ReadonlyArray<ClassificationNode>
  readonly metadata?: {
    readonly budgetLevel?: 'central' | 'local'
    readonly importance?: 'high' | 'normal'
    readonly watchFlag?: boolean
  }
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - expandedNodes: Set<string> (codes of expanded nodes)
 * - selectedNode: string | null (currently selected code)
 * - searchQuery: string (for filtering nodes)
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Click expand arrow → toggle node expansion
 * - Click node text → select and show details
 * - Type in search → filter visible nodes
 * - Click "Collapse All" → reset expandedNodes
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click arrow/chevron to expand/collapse
 * - Click code/name to select and see description
 * - Type to filter (search debounced 300ms)
 * - Keyboard: Arrow Up/Down to navigate, Enter to expand, Escape to clear
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Collapsed: shows "▶" indicator
 * - Expanded: shows "▼" indicator, children visible
 * - Selected: highlighted background, details panel visible
 * - Highlighted: pulsing border for important codes
 * - Filtered out: hidden from view
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Expand/collapse: smooth height transition (200ms)
 * - Selection: background fade (150ms)
 * - Filter: fade out filtered items (150ms)
 * - Highlight pulse: subtle scale animation (1s loop)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="tree" on container
 * - role="treeitem" on each node
 * - aria-expanded for expandable nodes
 * - aria-selected for current selection
 * - aria-level for depth indication
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Hierarchical tree with expand/collapse
- Search/filter functionality
- Click to see full description
- Link to full Classification Explorer
- Highlighted codes for important categories (65, 66, 68)

## Core Explanation

### Main Functional Categories

| Code | Function | What it covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **50** | General Public Services | Government operations, public administration |
| **51** | Defense | Military, national security |
| **54** | Public Order & Safety | Police, courts, prisons, fire services |
| **55** | Economic Affairs | Transport, agriculture, energy subsidies |
| **56** | Environment | Waste management, pollution control |
| **65** | Education | Schools, universities, training |
| **66** | Health | Hospitals, clinics, public health |
| **67** | Culture, Recreation | Museums, sports, religious affairs |
| **68** | Social Protection | Pensions, social assistance, unemployment |

### Understanding Code Structure

Functional codes have a hierarchical structure:

```
65.02.04.01
│  │  │  │
│  │  │  └── Detail level (Lower secondary = grades 5-8)
│  │  └───── Subfunction (Secondary education)
│  └──────── Budget level (.01 = central, .02 = local)
└─────────── Main function (Education)
```

### The .01 vs .02 Pattern

This is crucial for Romania:
- **.01** = Central government level (Ministry budget)
- **.02** = Local government level (City/County budget)

So `65.01` is education funded from the Ministry of Education's central budget, while `65.02` is education funded from local (municipal/county) budgets.

### Quick Reference: Functions at a Glance

```
50-59 = GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS (administration, defense, order)
60-69 = SOCIAL SERVICES (education, health, culture)
70-79 = ECONOMIC & INFRASTRUCTURE (housing, environment)
80-89 = FINANCIAL & OTHER
```

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="functional-classification-q1"
  question="What function does code '66' represent?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Health", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Defense", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Social Protection", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 66 is Health — covering hospitals, clinics, public health programs, and medical services. Code 65 is Education, 51 is Defense, and 68 is Social Protection."
/>

<Quiz
  id="functional-classification-q2"
  question="In code '65.02.04', what does the '.02' indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The second year of a budget cycle", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Local government budget level", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Secondary education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "February spending", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="In Romanian functional codes, '.01' means central (national) level and '.02' means local (city/county) level. So 65.02 is Education funded from local budgets, while 65.01 would be Education funded from the central Ministry budget."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Functional classification (COFOG) tells you the PURPOSE of spending. Key codes to know: 65=Education, 66=Health, 68=Social Protection. The .01/.02 suffix indicates central vs local budget level.
