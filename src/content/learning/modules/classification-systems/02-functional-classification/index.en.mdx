# Functional Classification

## Concept Introduction

Functional classification answers the question: **"What is this money FOR?"** It groups all spending by PURPOSE, regardless of which institution spends it or what type of expense it is.

Romania's functional classification is **adapted from** the international COFOG (Classification of Functions of Government) standard. While the international COFOG uses codes 01-10, Romania uses a national coding system (primarily codes 50-87) organized into five functional "Parts" (Părți). This Romanian system **maps to COFOG** for Eurostat reporting, enabling international comparisons.

> **Key Insight:** Functional codes reveal PRIORITIES. If a government says education is important but code 65 gets only 3% of the budget, actions speak louder than words.

### ClassificationTree Component

```typescript
/**
 * ClassificationTree Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Provide an expandable, interactive hierarchy view of functional
 * or economic classification codes for exploration and learning.
 */
interface ClassificationTreeProps {
  readonly type: 'functional' | 'economic'
  readonly data: ReadonlyArray<ClassificationNode>
  readonly initialExpanded?: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly highlightCodes?: ReadonlyArray<string>
  readonly onNodeClick?: (node: ClassificationNode) => void
  readonly onExplorerLink?: () => void
}

interface ClassificationNode {
  readonly code: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly nameRo?: string
  readonly description?: string
  readonly children?: ReadonlyArray<ClassificationNode>
  readonly metadata?: {
    readonly budgetLevel?: 'central' | 'local'
    readonly importance?: 'high' | 'normal'
    readonly watchFlag?: boolean
  }
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - expandedNodes: Set<string> (codes of expanded nodes)
 * - selectedNode: string | null (currently selected code)
 * - searchQuery: string (for filtering nodes)
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Click expand arrow → toggle node expansion
 * - Click node text → select and show details
 * - Type in search → filter visible nodes
 * - Click "Collapse All" → reset expandedNodes
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click arrow/chevron to expand/collapse
 * - Click code/name to select and see description
 * - Type to filter (search debounced 300ms)
 * - Keyboard: Arrow Up/Down to navigate, Enter to expand, Escape to clear
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Collapsed: shows "▶" indicator
 * - Expanded: shows "▼" indicator, children visible
 * - Selected: highlighted background, details panel visible
 * - Highlighted: pulsing border for important codes
 * - Filtered out: hidden from view
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Expand/collapse: smooth height transition (200ms)
 * - Selection: background fade (150ms)
 * - Filter: fade out filtered items (150ms)
 * - Highlight pulse: subtle scale animation (1s loop)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="tree" on container
 * - role="treeitem" on each node
 * - aria-expanded for expandable nodes
 * - aria-selected for current selection
 * - aria-level for depth indication
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Hierarchical tree with expand/collapse
- Search/filter functionality
- Click to see full description
- Link to full Classification Explorer
- Highlighted codes for important categories (65, 66, 68)

## Core Explanation

### Main Functional Categories

Romania organizes functional expenditure into **five Parts** (Părți):

**Part I — General Public Services:**

| Code | Function | What it covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **51** | Public Authorities | Executive, legislative organs, external affairs |
| **53** | Research | Fundamental research and R&D |
| **54** | Other General Services | General public services not elsewhere classified |
| **55** | Public Debt | Debt transactions and interest payments |

**Part II — Defense and Security:**

| Code | Function | What it covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **60** | Defense | Military, national security |
| **61** | Public Order & Safety | Police, courts, prisons, fire services |

**Part III — Social-Cultural Expenditures:**

| Code | Function | What it covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **65** | Education | Schools, universities, training |
| **66** | Health | Hospitals, clinics, public health |
| **67** | Culture, Recreation | Museums, sports, religious affairs |
| **68** | Social Protection | Pensions, social assistance, unemployment |

**Part IV — Public Services and Development:**

| Code | Function | What it covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **70** | Housing & Development | Housing, public utilities, urban development |
| **74** | Environment | Waste management, pollution control |

**Part V — Economic Actions:**

| Code | Function | What it covers |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **80** | Economic & Labor | General economic actions, labor programs |
| **84** | Transportation | Roads, railways, air and water transport |
| **87** | Other Economic | Agriculture, energy, industry subsidies |

### Understanding Code Structure

Functional codes have a hierarchical structure:

```
65.02.04.01
│  │  │  │
│  │  │  └── Detail level (Lower secondary = grades 5-8)
│  │  └───── Subfunction (Secondary education)
│  └──────── Budget level (.01 = central, .02 = local)
└─────────── Main function (Education)
```

### The .01 vs .02 Pattern

This is crucial for Romania:
- **.01** = Central government level (Ministry budget)
- **.02** = Local government level (City/County budget)

So `65.01` is education funded from the Ministry of Education's central budget, while `65.02` is education funded from local (municipal/county) budgets.

### Quick Reference: Key Codes to Remember

| Part | Codes | Focus Area |
|------|-------|------------|
| **I** | 51, 53, 54, 55 | Government operations, public admin |
| **II** | 60, 61 | Defense and public order |
| **III** | 65, 66, 67, 68 | Social services (education, health, culture, welfare) |
| **IV** | 70, 74 | Housing and environment |
| **V** | 80, 84, 87 | Economic actions and transport |

> **Note:** Romania uses specific non-sequential codes, not continuous ranges. Codes like 52, 62-64, 71-73, etc. are **not defined**.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="functional-classification-q1"
  question="What function does code '66' represent?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Health", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Defense", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Social Protection", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Code 66 is Health — covering hospitals, clinics, public health programs, and medical services. Code 65 is Education, 60 is Defense, and 68 is Social Protection."
/>

<Quiz
  id="functional-classification-q2"
  question="In code '65.02.04', what does the '.02' indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The second year of a budget cycle", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Local government budget level", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Secondary education", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "February spending", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="In Romanian functional codes, '.01' means central (national) level and '.02' means local (city/county) level. So 65.02 is Education funded from local budgets, while 65.01 would be Education funded from the central Ministry budget."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Romania's functional classification (COFOG-adapted) tells you the PURPOSE of spending. Key codes to know: 60=Defense, 61=Public Order, 65=Education, 66=Health, 68=Social Protection. The .01/.02 suffix indicates central vs local budget level.
