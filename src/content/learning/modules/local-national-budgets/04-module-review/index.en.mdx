    { id: "b", text: "About 1,500", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "About 3,229", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "About 10,000", isCorrect: false }
  ]}

<Quiz
  id="local-national-review-q2"
  question="What does the suffix '.02' in a budget code like '65.02' indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "The budget is for 2002", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It's a secondary priority", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "The spending is at local government level", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "It's the second version of the budget", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Budget level suffixes: .01 = central/state budget, .02 = local budget, .03 = social insurance, .05 = health insurance. So 65.02 means Education funded from local budget, while 65.01 means Education funded from state budget."

<Quiz
  id="local-national-review-q3"
  question="Why do wealthier cities (Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara) often have better local services than rural communes?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "They receive more money from the central government", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "They collect more 'own revenues' from local taxes and fees", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Rural areas don't need as many services", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "It's just a coincidence", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Local 'own revenues' (property tax, local fees) depend on local economic activity. Cities with more businesses and higher property values collect more. While equalization transfers help, they don't fully close the gap. This creates persistent inequality in local service quality."

<Quiz
  id="local-national-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Classification) When analyzing a village's budget, which suffix tells you the money is controlled locally?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: ".01 - central budget", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: ".02 - local budget", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: ".03 - social insurance", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Villages don't have their own budgets", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Communes (which include villages) have their own budgets at the .02 level. When you see 65.02 in a commune's budget, that's education spending under local control. State-level education programs would appear under 65.01. Understanding this helps you identify who's responsible for what."
