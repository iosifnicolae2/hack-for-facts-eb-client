# Budget Levels Explained

## Concept Introduction

The national budget gets the headlines, but it's actually just one piece of a larger puzzle. Romania's public finances are organized into a **Consolidated General Budget** that combines money from multiple sources and levels of government.

Think of it as a family where each member manages their own wallet, but they all contribute to shared household expenses. The government, counties, cities, and social insurance funds each have their own budgets — but they're all connected.

> **Key Insight:** Local budgets often have more direct impact on your daily life than the national budget. Roads, parks, and water are local responsibilities, while schools have split funding — local budgets cover infrastructure and operations, but teacher salaries come from the state budget.

**Component Interface:**

```typescript
/**
 * BudgetHierarchyVisualizer - Interactive tree diagram of budget structure
 *
 * PURPOSE: Help users understand the relationship between different budget levels
 */
interface BudgetHierarchyVisualizerProps {
  readonly levels: readonly BudgetLevel[]
  readonly onLevelSelect?: (levelId: string) => void
  readonly initialExpandedLevel?: string
}

interface BudgetLevel {
  readonly id: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly nameRo: string
  readonly percentage: number
  readonly amount: string // e.g., "~600B RON"
  readonly description: string
  readonly children?: readonly BudgetLevel[]
  readonly examples?: readonly string[]
}

/**
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * - selectedLevel: string | null (currently highlighted level)
 * - expandedLevels: Set<string> (which levels show children)
 * - hoveredLevel: string | null (for hover effects)
 *
 * STATE TRANSITIONS:
 * - Click level → toggle expanded, set selectedLevel
 * - Hover level → set hoveredLevel
 * - Keyboard Enter/Space → toggle selected level
 *
 * USER INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click on box: expand/collapse children, show details panel
 * - Hover: subtle elevation + glow effect
 * - Keyboard: Tab to navigate, Enter to select
 * - Touch: tap to expand, long-press for details
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: subtle border, hierarchy lines visible
 * - Hovered: scale(1.02), shadow elevation, border highlight
 * - Selected: accent border, expanded details panel
 * - Expanded: children visible with stagger animation
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Entry: nodes fade-in + scale from center (400ms, staggered 100ms)
 * - Expand: children slide-down + fade-in (300ms)
 * - Selection: border pulse animation (200ms)
 * - Hover: scale + shadow transition (150ms, ease-out)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="tree" on container
 * - role="treeitem" on each level
 * - aria-expanded for expandable items
 * - aria-selected for current selection
 * - aria-label with level name and percentage

```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Users can click any budget level to see details
- Children expand with smooth animation
- Percentage bars visualize relative sizes
- Deep links available to Budget Explorer for each category

## The Three Pillars

Romania's Consolidated General Budget (~600+ billion RON) consists of three main pillars:

| Pillar | Share | What It Covers |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **State Budget** | ~50% | Ministries, defense, foreign affairs, justice, national programs |
| **Local Budgets** | ~25% | Counties (41), municipalities, towns, communes — local services |
| **Social Insurance** | ~25% | Pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits |

### Why This Matters

When you hear "the government cut the budget," you need to ask: **which budget?** A cut to the state budget affects national programs, while a cut to local budgets directly impacts your roads, schools, and parks.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="local-national-01-q1"
  question="What percentage of Romania's consolidated budget goes to local governments?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "About 50%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "About 25%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "About 10%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "About 35%", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Local budgets receive approximately 25% of Romania's consolidated budget. This funds 41 counties, municipalities, towns, and communes — all 3,228 administrative units that provide local services. The state budget (~50%) and social insurance (~25%) make up the rest."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Romania's public budget isn't a single pot of money — it's a consolidated structure with three pillars: State Budget (~50%), Local Budgets (~25%), and Social Insurance (~25%). Understanding this structure helps you know which level is responsible for the services you use.
