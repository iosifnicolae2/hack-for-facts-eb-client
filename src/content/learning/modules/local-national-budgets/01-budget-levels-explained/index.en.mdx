# Budget Levels Explained

## Concept Introduction

The national budget gets the headlines, but it's actually just one piece of a larger puzzle. Romania's public finances are organized into a **Consolidated General Budget** that combines money from multiple sources and levels of government.

Think of it as a family where each member manages their own wallet, but they all contribute to shared household expenses. The government, counties, cities, and social insurance funds each have their own budgets — but they're all connected.

> **Key Insight:** Local budgets often have more direct impact on your daily life than the national budget. Roads, parks, and water are local responsibilities, while schools have split funding — local budgets cover infrastructure and operations, but teacher salaries come from the state budget.

## The Three Pillars

Romania's Consolidated General Budget (**727 billion RON** in 2024 executed expenditures) consists of three main pillars:

| Pillar | Share | Amount (2024) | What It Covers |
|--------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **State Budget** | ~53% | 389B RON | Ministries, defense, justice, Parliament, transfers to local budgets |
| **Local Budgets** | ~19% | 137B RON | 41 counties, 103 municipalities, 216 towns, 2,862 communes |
| **Social Insurance** | ~28% | 209B RON | Pensions (CNPP), healthcare (CNAS), unemployment (ANOFM) |

> **Note:** This three-pillar structure is a pedagogical simplification. The legal framework (Law 500/2002) defines ten distinct budget categories, including special funds, autonomous institutions, and EU funds (PNRR). The percentages are approximate and vary between revenue and expenditure calculations.

### Why This Matters

When you hear "the government cut the budget," you need to ask: **which budget?** A cut to the state budget affects national programs, while a cut to local budgets directly impacts your roads, schools, and parks.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="local-national-01-q1"
  question="What percentage of Romania's consolidated budget expenditures goes to local governments (2024 data)?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "About 50%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "About 19%", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "About 10%", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "About 35%", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Local budgets receive approximately 19% of Romania's consolidated budget expenditures (137B of 727B RON in 2024). This funds all 3,228 administrative units: 41 counties, 103 municipalities, 216 towns, and 2,862 communes. The state budget (~53%) and social insurance (~28%) make up the rest."

## Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Remember:** Romania's public budget isn't a single pot of money — it's a consolidated structure with three main pillars: State Budget (~53%), Local Budgets (~19%), and Social Insurance (~28%). In 2024, total expenditures reached 727 billion RON. Understanding this structure helps you know which level is responsible for the services you use.
