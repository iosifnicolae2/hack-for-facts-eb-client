# Revenue Collection

Public money comes from several sources. Let's understand them one by one.

## Main sources of revenue

### 1. Taxes and duties
- **Income tax** - paid by employees and companies
- **VAT** - tax on goods and services
- **Excise duties** - special taxes on fuel, tobacco, alcohol

### 2. Social contributions
- Pensions
- Healthcare
- Unemployment

### 3. European funds
Romania receives funds from the European Union for:
- Infrastructure (roads, railways)
- Agriculture
- Education and research

## Key takeaway

Budget revenues are estimated at the beginning of the year. Actual collection can be different!
