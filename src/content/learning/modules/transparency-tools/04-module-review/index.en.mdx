## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="transparency-review-q1"
  question="What is the primary official source for Romania's national budget execution data?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Wikipedia", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Ministry of Finance (mfinante.gov.ro)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "European Commission", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "News websites", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The Ministry of Finance (MFP) is the authoritative source for budget data. They publish monthly execution reports, the annual budget law, and rectifications. Transparenta.eu aggregates this data into user-friendly visualizations, but MFP is the primary source."
/>

<Quiz
  id="transparency-review-q2"
  question="What can you find on e-Licitatie (SEAP) that isn't available in budget documents?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Total spending by category", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Specific contracts, winners, and procurement methods used", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Historical budget trends", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Tax revenue breakdowns", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Budget documents show totals; e-Licitatie shows the specifics: which company won the contract, was it competitive bidding or direct award, what was the contract value. This is essential for investigating whether procurement was fair."
/>

<Quiz
  id="transparency-review-q3"
  question="When using Transparenta.eu to compare cities, what view should you use for fair comparison?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Total spending in RON", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Per capita spending (spending divided by population)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Percentage change from last year", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Number of budget lines", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Per capita view normalizes for population size. Cluj-Napoca spending 500M RON vs. a village spending 2M RON isn't comparable. But if Cluj spends 1,500 RON per person and the village spends 800 RON per person, now you can meaningfully compare."

<Quiz
  id="transparency-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Foundations) Which law guarantees your right to request budget information not published online?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Law 544/2001 on free access to public information", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "b", text: "Law 52/2003 on public participation", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "The Constitution", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "There is no such law", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="When official portals and Transparenta.eu don't have the specific data you need, Law 544/2001 is your tool. You can request any public information within 10 days (standard) or 30 days (complex). This complements online transparency tools."
