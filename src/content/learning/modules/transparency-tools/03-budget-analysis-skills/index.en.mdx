# Budget Analysis Skills

## Concept Introduction

Having access to budget data is only half the battle. The real skill is knowing **what to look for**. Raw numbers don't tell stories — patterns, anomalies, and comparisons do.

This lesson teaches you the five key metrics that reveal whether public money is being spent wisely. Master these, and you'll be able to quickly assess any institution's budget health.

> **Key Insight:** Budget analysis isn't about memorizing numbers. It's about asking the right questions: Is the money being spent? How does this compare? What changed?

## Core Explanation

### The Five Key Metrics

#### 1. Execution Rate

The most important single metric. It shows whether planned spending actually happened.

**Formula:** (Actual Spending / Planned Budget) x 100%

| Rate | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| >90% | Healthy execution | Normal — plans matched reality |
| 70-90% | Moderate gap | Investigate — what wasn't delivered? |
| <70% | Red flag | Serious concern — promises broken |

#### 2. Year-over-Year Change

Comparing the same category across years reveals priorities and trends.

**Red flags:**
- Sudden drops (>20%) in investment spending
- Steady increases in personnel while services decline
- Election-year spikes followed by cuts

#### 3. Per Capita Spending

Total budgets are misleading. A city of 500,000 spending 1 billion RON is very different from a town of 10,000 spending the same.

**Always normalize:** Divide total spending by population to get per capita figures. Then compare similar-sized entities.

#### 4. Investment vs Personnel Ratio

Look at the balance between:
- **Code 10 (Personnel):** Salaries and wages
- **Code 71 (Capital investments):** Infrastructure, equipment

High personnel spending with low investment suggests an institution focused on maintaining bureaucracy rather than delivering services or building infrastructure.

#### 5. Rectification Patterns

Budget rectifications (amendments during the year) reveal planning quality:
- **Many small rectifications:** Poor forecasting
- **Large cuts to specific areas:** Broken promises
- **Increases near year-end:** Potential end-of-year spending rush

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="transparency-tools-03-q1"
  question="An institution has a 55% execution rate for investments. What does this indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Excellent efficiency — they saved money", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Normal performance — most institutions are similar", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Significant underspending — a red flag that planned projects weren't delivered", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Good planning — they anticipated lower costs", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="A 55% execution rate means almost half the planned investment budget was NOT spent. This is a serious red flag indicating that infrastructure projects, equipment purchases, or other capital investments didn't happen as promised. Always investigate why."
/>

<Quiz
  id="transparency-tools-03-q2"
  question="Why is per capita spending useful for comparison?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "It's required by law for all budget reports", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It normalizes for population size, making comparisons between different-sized entities meaningful", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "It's easier to calculate than total spending", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "All public budgets are the same size anyway", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Per capita spending divides total budget by population, allowing fair comparisons. A city of 100,000 people spending 500M RON and a town of 10,000 spending 50M RON have the same per capita spending (5,000 RON/person), even though their total budgets differ by 10x."
/>

## Key Takeaway

> Master five metrics for budget analysis: **Execution rate** (is money being spent?), **Y/Y change** (what's trending?), **Per capita** (fair comparisons), **Investment vs Personnel** (priorities), and **Rectification patterns** (planning quality). Always compare: planned vs actual, this year vs last year, entity vs neighbors.
