# Budget Analysis Skills

## Concept Introduction

Having access to budget data is only half the battle. The real skill is knowing **what to look for**. Raw numbers don't tell stories — patterns, anomalies, and comparisons do.

This lesson teaches you the five key metrics that reveal whether public money is being spent wisely. Master these, and you'll be able to quickly assess any institution's budget health.

> **Key Insight:** Budget analysis isn't about memorizing numbers. It's about asking the right questions: Is the money being spent? How does this compare? What changed?

## Core Explanation

### The Five Key Metrics

#### 1. Execution Rate

The most important single metric. It shows whether planned spending actually happened.

**Formula:** (Actual Spending / Planned Budget) x 100%

The international PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability) standard provides these thresholds:

| Rate | PEFA Score | Meaning |
|------|------------|---------|
| 95-105% | A (Excellent) | Optimal execution — plans matched reality |
| 90-110% | B (Good) | Acceptable deviation |
| 85-115% | C (Basic) | Needs improvement — investigate gaps |
| Outside 85-115% | D (Poor) | Serious concern — >15% deviation |

> **Note:** A 55% execution rate represents a 45% underspend — deep into "Poor" territory under PEFA standards.

#### 2. Year-over-Year Change

Comparing the same category across years reveals priorities and trends.

**Materiality thresholds (UN IPSAS Framework):**
- **Under 5%:** Presumed immaterial
- **5-10%:** Requires professional judgment
- **Over 10%:** Presumed material — investigate
- **Over 20%:** Clearly material — requires detailed explanation

**Red flags:**
- Sudden drops (>10%) in investment spending
- Steady increases in personnel while services decline
- Election-year spikes followed by cuts

#### 3. Per Capita Spending

Total budgets are misleading. A city of 500,000 spending 1 billion RON is very different from a town of 10,000 spending the same.

**Always normalize:** Divide total spending by population to get per capita figures. Then compare similar-sized entities.

#### 4. Investment vs Personnel Ratio

Look at the balance between:
- **Code 10 (Personnel):** Salaries and wages
- **Code 71 (Non-financial assets):** Infrastructure, equipment, major repairs

High personnel spending with low investment suggests an institution focused on maintaining bureaucracy rather than delivering services or building infrastructure.

#### 5. Rectification Patterns

Budget rectifications (amendments during the year) reveal planning quality.

**Legal limits differ by level:**
- **State budget:** Maximum 2 rectifications per year, prohibited in first 6 months (Law 69/2010)
- **Local budgets:** No legal limit — 10+ per year is common and legal (Law 273/2006)

**What to watch for:**
- **Large cuts to specific areas:** Broken promises
- **Increases near year-end:** Potential end-of-year spending rush
- **Election-year patterns:** Pre-election spending spikes followed by post-election cuts

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="transparency-tools-03-q1"
  question="An institution has a 55% execution rate for investments. What does this indicate?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Excellent efficiency — they saved money", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Normal performance — most institutions are similar", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Significant underspending — a red flag that planned projects weren't delivered", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Good planning — they anticipated lower costs", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="A 55% execution rate means almost half the planned budget for non-financial assets was NOT spent. Under PEFA standards, this represents a 45% deviation — deep into 'Poor' (D) territory where anything outside 85-115% is considered serious. This indicates infrastructure projects, equipment purchases, or major repairs didn't happen as promised. Always investigate why."
/>

<Quiz
  id="transparency-tools-03-q2"
  question="Why is per capita spending useful for comparison?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "It's required by law for all budget reports", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "It normalizes for population size, making comparisons between different-sized entities meaningful", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "It's easier to calculate than total spending", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "All public budgets are the same size anyway", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Per capita spending divides total budget by population, allowing fair comparisons. A city of 100,000 people spending 500M RON and a town of 10,000 spending 50M RON have the same per capita spending (5,000 RON/person), even though their total budgets differ by 10x."
/>

---

## Key Takeaway

> Master five metrics for budget analysis: **Execution rate** (is money being spent?), **Y/Y change** (what's trending?), **Per capita** (fair comparisons), **Investment vs Personnel** (priorities), and **Rectification patterns** (planning quality). Always compare: planned vs actual, this year vs last year, entity vs neighbors.
