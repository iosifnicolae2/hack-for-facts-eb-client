# Official Data Sources

## Concept Introduction

Budget transparency in Romania has improved dramatically over the past decade. The data exists — you just need to know where to find it. But with multiple government portals, each serving different purposes, navigating the landscape can be confusing.

The good news? There are only **four main sources** you need to know. Each has a specific strength, and together they give you a complete picture of public finances.

> **Key Insight:** Romania publishes more budget data than most citizens realize. Your advantage is knowing where to look.

## Core Explanation

### The Four Pillars of Budget Transparency

Each source serves a distinct purpose in the budget transparency ecosystem:

| Source | Purpose | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Ministry of Finance** | Policy & planning | You need budget laws, fiscal strategy, debt statistics, or national aggregates |
| **Forexebug** | Execution reporting | You need to understand how 14,000+ institutions report budget execution (note: limited public access) |
| **SEAP** | Procurement tracking | You're following specific contracts or suppliers |
| **Court of Accounts** | Audit findings | You're looking for verified problems — they audit 1,300+ entities yearly |

### Important Access Notes

**Forexebug requires authentication.** Unlike the other sources, Forexebug requires a qualified digital signature certificate and Treasury registration for full data access. Public users can only access forms, templates, and guidance documents.

**SEAP has usability barriers.** Every page requires CAPTCHA completion, searches are limited to single CPV codes, and bulk data exports stopped in 2018 when SICAP replaced SEAP.

**Court of Accounts is freely accessible.** All audit reports are downloadable as PDFs without registration — this is often the most accessible source for finding documented problems.

### Pro Tips

**Start with Court of Accounts** when investigating — they may have already documented irregularities. In 2024, they found procurement violations in 58% of audited entities.

**Cross-reference SEAP with audit reports.** Court of Accounts often identifies procurement-related damages that you can then trace back to specific contracts.

**Use data.gov.ro for bulk data.** The Ministry of Finance publishes 97 datasets there, including state budget XML data and government debt reports.

## Additional Sources

Beyond the four main sources, these portals provide valuable complementary data:

| Source | URL | What You'll Find |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| **data.gov.ro** | data.gov.ro | 4,800+ open datasets from 177 organizations, including Ministry of Finance budget data |
| **European Commission** | economy-finance.ec.europa.eu | Romania's fiscal plans, draft budgets, and EU procedure documentation |
| **Eurostat** | ec.europa.eu/eurostat | Standardized EU statistics for cross-country comparisons |
| **EU Cohesion Data** | cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu | EU Structural Funds data for Romania (2014-2027) |

## Reality Check: Data Quality

Romania scores **62/100** on the 2023 Open Budget Index — sufficient for informed debate but trailing neighbors like Moldova (81) and Bulgaria (79).

**Key limitations to be aware of:**
- SEAP bulk exports stopped in 2018, making historical analysis difficult
- Forexebug has restricted public access — most data requires authentication
- SEAP CAPTCHAs and single-CPV search limits slow down research
- Some Court of Accounts recommendations have only 82% implementation rate

Despite these barriers, investigative journalists have used these sources effectively — the RISE Project's Tel Drum investigation and Recorder's Orthodox Church investigation both relied on procurement and audit data to expose hundreds of millions in irregularities.

---

## Key Takeaway

> Four official sources cover Romanian budget data: Ministry of Finance (laws and strategy), Forexebug (execution reporting — limited public access), SEAP (procurement contracts — expect CAPTCHAs), and Court of Accounts (freely accessible audit findings). Start with Court of Accounts for documented problems, and use data.gov.ro for bulk data downloads.
