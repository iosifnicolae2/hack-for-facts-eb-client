# Strategic Planning

Develop sound budget proposals aligned with strategic priorities.

## The annual budget calendar

- **July 31**: MF sends expenditure limits to Government.
- **August 1**: MF sends framework letter (scrisoare-cadru) to OPCs.
- **September 1-15**: OPCs submit proposals to MF.
- **November 15**: Government submits to Parliament.
- **December 28**: Parliament votes budget law.

> **Critical:** Local budgets must be approved within **45 days** of state budget publication (Legea 273/2006).

## Building a budget proposal

1. **Baseline analysis**: Current year execution.
2. **Strategic alignment**: Policy priorities (Government program, PNRR).
3. **Needs assessment**: Personnel, goods/services, investments.
4. **Nota de fundamentare**: Legal basis, calculations, performance indicators.
