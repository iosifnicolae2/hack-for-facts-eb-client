## Module Quiz

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-review-q1"
  question="In what order do the six phases of the budget cycle occur?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Approval → Preparation → Execution → Audit → Presentation → Control", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Preparation → Presentation → Approval → Execution → Control → Audit", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Audit → Control → Execution → Approval → Presentation → Preparation", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Execution → Approval → Preparation → Audit → Control → Presentation", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The cycle follows a logical sequence: (1) Preparation (ministries draft proposals), (2) Presentation (to Parliament), (3) Approval (Parliament votes), (4) Execution (spending throughout the year), (5) Control (ongoing monitoring), (6) Audit (final review by Court of Accounts)."

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-review-q2"
  question="Why are budget rectifications important for citizen oversight?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "They are purely administrative and don't affect spending", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "They show where priorities shifted during the year and can redirect billions", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "They only happen in emergency situations", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "They are secret documents not available to citizens", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Rectifications can shift billions of RON between categories—often cutting investments to cover overruns on salaries or social spending. They reveal what actually happened vs. what was promised in the original budget. Romania typically has 2-3 rectifications per year, usually in July and November."

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-review-q3"
  question="When is the best time to influence budget decisions for your community?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "After the budget is approved by Parliament", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "During the preparation phase (September-October) before Parliament receives it", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "During the audit phase", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Budget decisions cannot be influenced by citizens", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The preparation phase (September-October) is when ministries and local governments draft their proposals. Once Parliament receives the budget, major changes are rare. Engaging during preparation—attending public consultations, contacting local officials—is most effective."

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-review-q4"
  question="(Recall from Expenditures) If a rectification shows investments cut by 20% while personnel increased by 5%, what pattern does this confirm?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Efficient reallocation of resources", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "The execution gap—investments sacrificed for mandatory costs", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Investment projects were completed early", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "Personnel costs were originally underestimated", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="This rectification pattern confirms the execution gap from the Expenditures module: when budgets face pressure, investments (Code 71) get cut because they're flexible, while personnel (Code 10) grows because salaries are mandatory. Watching rectifications reveals this trade-off in real-time."
