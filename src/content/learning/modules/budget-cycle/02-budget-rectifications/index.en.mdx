# Budget Rectifications Explained

## Concept Introduction

What happens when reality doesn't match the plan? Governments adjust their budgets mid-year through a process called **rectification**. Understanding rectifications helps you separate normal adjustments from red flags that indicate poor planning or broken promises.

Think of it like adjusting your personal budget: if you get a raise, you might allocate more to savings. If an unexpected expense comes up, you might cut entertainment spending. The government does the same thing — but with YOUR money.

> **Key Insight:** Some rectifications are normal and necessary. But frequent or large rectifications often signal poor planning, broken promises, or political manipulation.

## What Are Budget Rectifications?

A budget rectification is a **formal change to the approved annual budget** during the fiscal year. It requires a new law passed by Parliament, just like the original budget.

### Common Reasons for Rectifications

| Reason | Example | Concern Level |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Revenue changes** | Tax collection higher/lower than expected | Normal |
| **EU funds received** | New EU project approved | Normal |
| **Emergency spending** | Natural disaster response | Normal |
| **Political priorities** | Election-year spending increases | Watch carefully |
| **Poor initial planning** | Unrealistic revenue projections | Red flag |
| **Hidden spending** | Adding projects not in original budget | Red flag |

## Red Flags to Watch For

Not all rectifications are problematic, but some patterns should raise concerns:

### Questions to Ask About Any Rectification

1. **Is it through OUG or Parliament?** OUG bypasses proper legislative debate
2. **What's the new deficit target?** Compare to original budget and EU limits (3% GDP)
3. **Is it an election year?** Pre-election spending spikes are common manipulation
4. **What changed from the original budget?** Large deviations suggest poor initial planning
5. **What does the Fiscal Council say?** Their opinions often highlight problems ignored by government

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-02-q1"
  question="What is a budget rectification?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Fixing calculation errors in the budget", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "A mid-year change to the approved budget", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "An annual audit correction", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "d", text: "A tax rate adjustment", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="A budget rectification is a formal mid-year change to the approved annual budget. Under Law 500/2002, it should require Parliament approval, but governments often use Emergency Ordinances (OUG) to bypass legislative debate. Law 69/2010 limits rectifications to maximum 2 per year and prohibits them in the first semester."

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-02-q2"
  question="Which of these is a RED FLAG in budget rectifications?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Adding EU/PNRR funds received mid-year", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Responding to a crisis like COVID-19", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Using the Reserve Fund to bypass formal rectification", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Small technical adjustments between categories", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="Using the Reserve Fund instead of formal rectification (as Romania did in 2023 with 32 billion lei) bypasses transparency requirements and Parliament oversight. In 2023, this approach was used for the first time in 30 years, drawing criticism from the Fiscal Council for being a 'de facto rectification' without proper debate."

## Key Takeaway

> **Remember:** Rectifications reveal whether a government keeps its budget promises. Romania has been under EU Excessive Deficit Procedure since 2020, with deficits ranging from 6% to 9.3% of GDP. Watch for: OUG bypassing Parliament, Reserve Fund bypasses, pre-election spending spikes, and deficits far above targets. Use Transparenta.eu to compare original budgets with actual execution.
