# The Six Phases of the Budget Cycle

## Concept Introduction

The budget isn't a one-time decision — it's a continuous cycle that repeats every year. Understanding WHEN decisions are made helps you know WHEN to pay attention and engage effectively.

Think of it like farming seasons: there's a time to plant, a time to tend, and a time to harvest. Similarly, the budget has distinct phases where different activities happen. Miss the right window, and you wait another year.

> **Key Insight:** November-December is "budget season" — the most important time for citizen engagement. The Government must submit the budget to Parliament by **November 15** (not October 15 as older sources state), following amendments made by Law 270/2013.

### Component Specification

```typescript
/**
 * BudgetCycleTimeline Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Visualize the budget cycle phases across a calendar year
 * with current date indicator and countdown to budget season
 */
interface BudgetCycleTimelineProps {
  readonly currentDate?: Date
  readonly onPhaseClick?: (phaseId: string) => void
  readonly highlightPhase?: string
}

interface BudgetPhase {
  readonly id: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly startMonth: number  // 1-12
  readonly endMonth: number
  readonly description: string
  readonly citizenOpportunity: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  readonly color: string
}

/**
 * STATE:
 * - currentDate: Date (defaults to today)
 * - activePhase: computed from currentDate
 * - expandedPhase: string | null (phase being viewed)
 * - daysUntilBudgetSeason: number (days until November 15)
 *
 * INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click phase segment: expand phase details
 * - Hover phase: show tooltip with quick info
 * - Arrow keys: navigate between phases
 * - Escape: collapse expanded phase
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: all phases visible with muted colors
 * - Current: current phase highlighted with pulse
 * - Hovered: slight scale up, brighter color
 * - Expanded: phase details panel slides in
 * - Budget season: special glow during Oct-Dec
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Current date marker: subtle pulse (2s loop)
 * - Phase expansion: slide + fade (300ms, ease-out)
 * - Countdown: number flip animation daily
 * - Entry: phases stagger in from left (600ms total)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="img" with aria-label describing the timeline
 * - Each phase is focusable with aria-describedby
 * - Screen reader announces current phase and countdown
 * - Color is not the only indicator (icons + patterns)
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Shows all 12 months with phase overlays
- Current date marked with pulsing indicator
- Click any phase to see details panel
- Countdown shows days until November 15 (budget submission deadline)
- Keyboard navigable between phases

## The Six Phases Explained

Every budget goes through these six phases. Here's what happens in each and when YOU can make a difference:

| Phase | Timing | What Happens | Legal Basis | Your Opportunity |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Planning** | Jun - Aug | Macroeconomic forecasts (Jun 1), spending ceilings (Jul 31), framework letter (Aug 1) | Art. 31-33 | Low - internal process |
| **Drafting** | Aug - Nov 15 | Institutions submit proposals (Sep 15), Ministry drafts budget (Sep 30), Government submits to Parliament (Nov 15) | Art. 34-35 | Medium - consultations may occur |
| **Approval** | Nov 15 - Dec | Parliament debates and votes; urgent procedure if not adopted by Dec 15 | Art. 17(2), 35(4) | **HIGH** - contact MPs, attend sessions |
| **Execution** | Jan - Dec | Institutions spend approved funds; rectifications possible (by Nov 30) | Art. 6, 61(1) | Medium - monitor execution rates |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly | Execution reports published; local budgets: Apr, Jul, Oct, Dec | Art. 44, 55; Law 273/2006 Art. 49(12) | Medium - analyze and question |
| **Audit** | Following year | Court of Accounts reviews spending, reports to Parliament by Jul 1 | Law 94/1992; Art. 56(4) | Low - read audit reports |

  question="When must the Government submit the budget to Parliament?"
  options={[

## Key Takeaway

> **Remember:** The budget cycle has six phases, but November-December is YOUR window. The legal deadline of **November 15** (not October 15 as older sources state) starts "budget season" — this is when your voice can influence how public money is allocated next year. For local budgets, you also have a 15-day contestation period under Law 273/2006.
