# The Six Phases of the Budget Cycle

## Concept Introduction

The budget isn't a one-time decision — it's a continuous cycle that repeats every year. Understanding WHEN decisions are made helps you know WHEN to pay attention and engage effectively.

Think of it like farming seasons: there's a time to plant, a time to tend, and a time to harvest. Similarly, the budget has distinct phases where different activities happen. Miss the right window, and you wait another year.

> **Key Insight:** November-December is "budget season" — the most important time for citizen engagement. The Government must submit the budget to Parliament by **November 15** (not October 15 as older sources state), following amendments made by Law 270/2013.

## The Six Phases Explained

Every budget goes through these six phases. Here's what happens in each and when YOU can make a difference:

| Phase | Timing | What Happens | Legal Basis | Your Opportunity |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Planning** | Jun - Aug | Macroeconomic forecasts (Jun 1), spending ceilings (Jul 31), framework letter (Aug 1) | Art. 31-33 | Low - internal process |
| **Drafting** | Aug - Nov 15 | Institutions submit proposals (Sep 15), Ministry drafts budget (Sep 30), Government submits to Parliament (Nov 15) | Art. 34-35 | Medium - consultations may occur |
| **Approval** | Nov 15 - Dec | Parliament debates and votes; urgent procedure if not adopted by Dec 15 | Art. 17(2), 35(4) | **HIGH** - contact MPs, attend sessions |
| **Execution** | Jan - Dec | Institutions spend approved funds; rectifications possible (by Nov 30) | Art. 6, 61(1) | Medium - monitor execution rates |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly | Execution reports published; local budgets: Apr, Jul, Oct, Dec | Art. 44, 55; Law 273/2006 Art. 49(12) | Medium - analyze and question |
| **Audit** | Following year | Court of Accounts reviews spending, reports to Parliament by Jul 1 | Law 94/1992; Art. 56(4) | Low - read audit reports |

## Key Deadline Alert

> **KEY DEADLINE: NOVEMBER 15**
>
> The Government **MUST** submit the budget to Parliament by November 15 each year (Law 500/2002, Art. 35(4)).
>
> **IMPORTANT:** The October 15 deadline often cited in older sources is **OUTDATED**. Law 270/2013 extended it by one month to November 15.
>
> If this deadline is missed, it signals:
> - Political instability or disagreements
> - Poor planning by the government
> - Potential budget execution problems
>
> **Other key dates:**
> - **Dec 15:** Urgent procedure required if not adopted
> - **Dec 31:** Execution year closes
>
> **Mark your calendar: November = Budget Season begins!**

## Key Takeaway

### What You Learned

The budget cycle has **six distinct phases**, each with its own timeline and engagement opportunities:

| Phase | Opportunity | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Planning | Low | Follow news about forecasts |
| Drafting | Medium | Participate in public consultations |
| **Approval** | **HIGH** | **Contact your MPs** |
| Execution | Medium | Monitor on Transparenta.eu |
| Reporting | Medium | Analyze reports |
| Audit | Low | Read audit findings |

### Key Dates to Remember

- **November 15** — Government submits budget to Parliament
- **December 15** — Urgent procedure if not adopted
- **December 31** — Budget must be approved

### Next Step

> **Take Action:** November-December is **YOUR WINDOW**. Mark **November 15** in your calendar — that's when "budget season" starts and your voice can influence how public money is allocated for the next year.
