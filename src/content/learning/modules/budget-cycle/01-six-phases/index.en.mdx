# The Six Phases of the Budget Cycle

## Concept Introduction

The budget isn't a one-time decision — it's a continuous cycle that repeats every year. Understanding WHEN decisions are made helps you know WHEN to pay attention and engage effectively.

Think of it like farming seasons: there's a time to plant, a time to tend, and a time to harvest. Similarly, the budget has distinct phases where different activities happen. Miss the right window, and you wait another year.

> **Key Insight:** October-December is "budget season" — the most important time for citizen engagement. This is when Parliament debates and approves next year's spending.

### Component Specification

```typescript
/**
 * BudgetCycleTimeline Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Visualize the budget cycle phases across a calendar year
 * with current date indicator and countdown to budget season
 */
interface BudgetCycleTimelineProps {
  readonly currentDate?: Date
  readonly onPhaseClick?: (phaseId: string) => void
  readonly highlightPhase?: string
}

interface BudgetPhase {
  readonly id: string
  readonly name: string
  readonly startMonth: number  // 1-12
  readonly endMonth: number
  readonly description: string
  readonly citizenOpportunity: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  readonly color: string
}

/**
 * STATE:
 * - currentDate: Date (defaults to today)
 * - activePhase: computed from currentDate
 * - expandedPhase: string | null (phase being viewed)
 * - daysUntilBudgetSeason: number (days until October 1)
 *
 * INTERACTIONS:
 * - Click phase segment: expand phase details
 * - Hover phase: show tooltip with quick info
 * - Arrow keys: navigate between phases
 * - Escape: collapse expanded phase
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Default: all phases visible with muted colors
 * - Current: current phase highlighted with pulse
 * - Hovered: slight scale up, brighter color
 * - Expanded: phase details panel slides in
 * - Budget season: special glow during Oct-Dec
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Current date marker: subtle pulse (2s loop)
 * - Phase expansion: slide + fade (300ms, ease-out)
 * - Countdown: number flip animation daily
 * - Entry: phases stagger in from left (600ms total)
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="img" with aria-label describing the timeline
 * - Each phase is focusable with aria-describedby
 * - Screen reader announces current phase and countdown
 * - Color is not the only indicator (icons + patterns)
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Shows all 12 months with phase overlays
- Current date marked with pulsing indicator
- Click any phase to see details panel
- Countdown shows days until October 1 (budget season start)
- Keyboard navigable between phases

## The Six Phases Explained

Every budget goes through these six phases. Here's what happens in each and when YOU can make a difference:

| Phase | Timing | What Happens | Your Opportunity |
|-------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Planning** | May - Aug | Ministry sets ceilings, institutions prepare requests | Low - internal process |
| **Drafting** | Sep - Oct 15 | Government consolidates requests | Medium - consultations may occur |
| **Approval** | Oct - Dec | Parliament debates and votes | **HIGH** - contact MPs, attend sessions |
| **Execution** | Jan - Dec | Institutions spend approved funds | Medium - monitor execution rates |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly | Execution reports published | Medium - analyze and question |
| **Audit** | Following year | Court of Accounts reviews spending | Low - read audit reports |

### Phase Details (Expanded Content)

**1. PLANNING (May-August)**
- Ministry of Finance sets spending ceilings
- Each institution prepares budget requests
- Internal negotiations happen
- **Your opportunity:** Limited — this is an internal government process

- Final vote usually in December
- **Your opportunity:** HIGH — contact your MPs, attend public sessions, submit written opinions

**4. EXECUTION (January-December)**
- Institutions spend according to approved budget
- Quarterly reports published
- Rectifications may occur
- **Your opportunity:** Monitor execution rates on Transparenta.eu

**5. REPORTING (Quarterly + Annual)**
- Execution reports made public
- Comparison: planned vs. actual
- Available on Forexebug and ministry sites
- **Your opportunity:** Analyze data, identify gaps, ask questions

**6. AUDIT (Following Year)**
- Court of Accounts reviews spending
