# Tracking Budget Documents

## Concept Introduction

Knowing WHAT to look for is just as important as knowing WHEN to look. Each phase of the budget cycle produces specific documents that tell different parts of the story. This lesson gives you a checklist of key documents and where to find them.

Think of it like tracking a court case: you need the original filing, the trial proceedings, and the verdict. For budgets, you need the proposal, the debates, and the execution reports.

> **Key Insight:** Budget transparency means documents are public — but they're scattered across multiple government websites. Knowing where to look saves hours of searching.

## Document Guide

### 1. During Approval (October-December)

| Document | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Budget Law Draft** | Complete proposed budget for next year | cdep.ro, senat.ro |
| **Budget Annexes** | Detailed allocations by ministry/institution | mfinante.gov.ro |
| **Justification Report** | Why amounts were chosen, economic projections | mfinante.gov.ro |

**Why these matter:** These documents show what the government PROMISES to spend. Compare them later to what actually happens.

### 2. During Execution (Quarterly)

| Document | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Execution Reports** | Actual spending vs. planned | mfinante.gov.ro, Forexebug |
| **Arrears Reports** | Unpaid debts by government entities | mfinante.gov.ro |
| **Rectification Laws** | Mid-year budget changes | cdep.ro |

**Why these matter:** These show reality vs. promises. Low execution rates mean money wasn't spent as planned.

### 3. After Audit (Following Year)

| Document | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Court of Accounts Reports** | Independent audit findings | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Irregularity Reports** | Specific problems found | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Follow-up Reports** | Whether past problems were fixed | curteadeconturi.ro |

**Why these matter:** Independent verification of whether money was spent legally and effectively.
