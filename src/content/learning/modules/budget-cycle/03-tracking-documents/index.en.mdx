# Tracking Budget Documents

## Concept Introduction

Knowing WHAT to look for is just as important as knowing WHEN to look. Each phase of the budget cycle produces specific documents that tell different parts of the story. This lesson gives you a checklist of key documents and where to find them.

Think of it like tracking a court case: you need the original filing, the trial proceedings, and the verdict. For budgets, you need the proposal, the debates, and the execution reports.

> **Key Insight:** Budget transparency means documents are public — but they're scattered across multiple government websites. Knowing where to look saves hours of searching.

### Why These Documents Matter

- **Approval phase documents** show what the government PROMISES to spend. Compare them later to what actually happens.
- **Execution phase documents** show reality vs. promises. Low execution rates mean money wasn't spent as planned.
- **Audit phase documents** provide independent verification of whether money was spent legally and effectively.

## Set Up Your Monitoring

### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Open the Alerts feature** at `/alerts` on Transparenta.eu
2. **Create an alert** for your local government — search for your city/commune and set alert for "new data available"
3. **Set calendar reminders** for budget season:
   - October 1: Check if draft is published
   - November 15: Review Parliament discussions
   - December 20: Final budget approved
4. **Bookmark key sources**: Ministry of Finance, Parliament (cdep.ro), Court of Accounts

## Calendar: Your Budget Year

Set these reminders to stay informed:

| Date | Action | Why |

| **October 1** | Check for budget draft | Budget season begins |
| **October 15** | Verify submission to Parliament | Legal deadline (Art. 35.4, Law 500/2002) |
| **November 15** | Review Parliament debates | Key discussion period |
| **December 15** | Target adoption date | Emergency procedures if not adopted |
| **Monthly** | Check execution reports | Monitor actual spending vs. planned |
| **12-18 months after fiscal year** | Read Court of Accounts reports | See audit findings |

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-03-q1"
  question="When are budget execution reports published?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Only at year end", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Quarterly", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Monthly", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Only during audits", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The Ministry of Finance publishes monthly consolidated budget execution data (e.g., 'Execuție bugetară la 31.10.2025'). Law 69/2010 also requires quarterly public evaluations, but execution reports are actually available monthly, allowing citizens to track spending more frequently than commonly believed."
/>

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-03-q2"
  question="Where would you find the Court of Accounts audit reports?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "mfinante.gov.ro (Ministry of Finance)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "cdep.ro (Chamber of Deputies)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "curteadeconturi.ro (Court of Accounts)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "gov.ro (Government portal)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The Court of Accounts (Curtea de Conturi) publishes its own audit reports on curteadeconturi.ro. These reports are independent assessments of how public money was spent and whether any irregularities were found."
/>

## Key Takeaway
