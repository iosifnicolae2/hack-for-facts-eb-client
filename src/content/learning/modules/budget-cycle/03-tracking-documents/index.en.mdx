# Tracking Budget Documents

## Concept Introduction

Knowing WHAT to look for is just as important as knowing WHEN to look. Each phase of the budget cycle produces specific documents that tell different parts of the story. This lesson gives you a checklist of key documents and where to find them.

Think of it like tracking a court case: you need the original filing, the trial proceedings, and the verdict. For budgets, you need the proposal, the debates, and the execution reports.

> **Key Insight:** Budget transparency means documents are public — but they're scattered across multiple government websites. Knowing where to look saves hours of searching.

## Document Guide

### 1. During Approval (October-December)

| Document | Romanian Name | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Budget Law Draft** | Proiectul legii bugetului de stat | Complete proposed budget for next year | cdep.ro, senat.ro |
| **Budget Annexes** | Anexe la buget (Anexa nr. 1, 2, etc.) | Detailed allocations by ministry/institution | mfinante.gov.ro |
| **Explanatory Memorandum** | Expunere de motive | Why amounts were chosen, economic projections | mfinante.gov.ro |

**Why these matter:** These documents show what the government PROMISES to spend. Compare them later to what actually happens.

### 2. During Execution (Monthly)

| Document | Romanian Name | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Execution Reports** | Rapoarte de execuție bugetară | Actual spending vs. planned (published monthly) | mfinante.gov.ro, Forexebug |
| **Arrears Reports** | Situația arieratelor (Form F1118) | Unpaid debts over 90 days by government entities | mfinante.gov.ro |
| **Rectification Laws** | Legi de rectificare | Mid-year budget changes | cdep.ro |

**Why these matter:** These show reality vs. promises. Low execution rates mean money wasn't spent as planned. Monthly reporting allows early detection of problems.

### 3. After Audit (12-18 Months After Fiscal Year)

| Document | Romanian Name | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Annual Public Report** | Raportul Public Anual | Comprehensive audit findings submitted to Parliament | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Financial Audit Reports** | Rapoarte de Audit Financiar | Opinions on entity financial statements | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Compliance Audit Reports** | Rapoarte de Audit de Conformitate | Regularity and legality verification | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Performance Audit Reports** | Rapoarte de Audit al Performanței | Economy, efficiency, effectiveness evaluation | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Follow-up Reports** | Rapoarte de Follow-up | Whether past problems were fixed | curteadeconturi.ro |

**Why these matter:** Independent verification of whether money was spent legally and effectively. Note: Reports typically publish 12-18 months after the fiscal year ends, not immediately in June.

## Practice

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-03-q1"
  question="When are budget execution reports published?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "Only at year end", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Quarterly", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "Monthly", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "Only during audits", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The Ministry of Finance publishes monthly consolidated budget execution data (e.g., 'Execuție bugetară la 31.10.2025'). Law 69/2010 also requires quarterly public evaluations, but execution reports are actually available monthly, allowing citizens to track spending more frequently than commonly believed."
/>

<Quiz
  id="budget-cycle-03-q2"
  question="Where would you find the Court of Accounts audit reports?"
  options={[
    { id: "a", text: "mfinante.gov.ro (Ministry of Finance)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "cdep.ro (Chamber of Deputies)", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "c", text: "curteadeconturi.ro (Court of Accounts)", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "d", text: "gov.ro (Government portal)", isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="The Court of Accounts (Curtea de Conturi) publishes its own audit reports on curteadeconturi.ro. These reports are independent assessments of how public money was spent and whether any irregularities were found."

## Key Takeaway
