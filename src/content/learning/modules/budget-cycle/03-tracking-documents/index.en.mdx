# Tracking Budget Documents

## Concept Introduction

Knowing WHAT to look for is just as important as knowing WHEN to look. Each phase of the budget cycle produces specific documents that tell different parts of the story. This lesson gives you a checklist of key documents and where to find them.

Think of it like tracking a court case: you need the original filing, the trial proceedings, and the verdict. For budgets, you need the proposal, the debates, and the execution reports.

> **Key Insight:** Budget transparency means documents are public — but they're scattered across multiple government websites. Knowing where to look saves hours of searching.

## Document Guide

### 1. During Approval (October-December)

| Document | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Budget Law Draft** | Complete proposed budget for next year | cdep.ro, senat.ro |
| **Budget Annexes** | Detailed allocations by ministry/institution | mfinante.gov.ro |
| **Justification Report** | Why amounts were chosen, economic projections | mfinante.gov.ro |

**Why these matter:** These documents show what the government PROMISES to spend. Compare them later to what actually happens.

### 2. During Execution (Quarterly)

| Document | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Execution Reports** | Actual spending vs. planned | mfinante.gov.ro, Forexebug |
| **Arrears Reports** | Unpaid debts by government entities | mfinante.gov.ro |
| **Rectification Laws** | Mid-year budget changes | cdep.ro |

**Why these matter:** These show reality vs. promises. Low execution rates mean money wasn't spent as planned.

### 3. After Audit (Following Year)

| Document | What It Contains | Where to Find |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Court of Accounts Reports** | Independent audit findings | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Irregularity Reports** | Specific problems found | curteadeconturi.ro |
| **Follow-up Reports** | Whether past problems were fixed | curteadeconturi.ro |

**Why these matter:** Independent verification of whether money was spent legally and effectively.

### Component Specification

```typescript
/**
 * GuidedActivity Component
 *
 * PURPOSE: Guide users through a multi-step platform walkthrough
 * with validation and progress tracking
 */
interface GuidedActivityProps {
  readonly title: string
  readonly description?: string
  readonly steps: readonly GuidedStep[]
  readonly onComplete?: () => void
  readonly allowSkip?: boolean
}

interface GuidedStep {
  readonly id: string
  readonly instruction: string
  readonly hint?: string
  readonly deepLink?: string  // Platform URL to open
  readonly externalLink?: string  // External URL (new tab)
  readonly validation: StepValidation
}

type StepValidation =
  | { type: 'manual' }  // User clicks "Done"
  | { type: 'input'; question: string; expectedAnswer: string | string[] }
  | { type: 'confirm'; question: string }

/**
 * STATE:
 * - currentStep: number (0-indexed)
 * - completedSteps: Set<string>
 * - stepInputs: Record<string, string>
 * - isComplete: boolean
 *
 * INTERACTIONS:
 * - "Open Link" button: opens deep link (same tab) or external link (new tab)
 * - "Mark Done" button: advances to next step
 * - Input submission: validates answer before proceeding
 * - "Skip" button: if allowSkip, moves to next without completion
 * - Back button: return to previous step
 * - Keyboard: Enter to advance, Tab to navigate
 *
 * VISUAL STATES:
 * - Pending step: dimmed, numbered badge
 * - Current step: full visibility, highlighted border
 * - Completed step: green checkmark, collapsed
 * - In progress: loading spinner on button
 * - All complete: celebration state, confetti optional
 *
 * ANIMATIONS:
 * - Step transition: slide-in from right (300ms)
 * - Completion: checkmark scale + fade (200ms)
 * - Error: shake animation (200ms)
 * - Progress bar: smooth width transition (300ms)
 * - Final: subtle celebration animation
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY:
 * - role="group" with aria-label for activity
 * - Steps announced as "Step X of Y"
 * - aria-current="step" on active step
 * - Completion status announced via aria-live
 * - External links announced with "opens in new tab"
 */
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Guides users through setting up budget monitoring
- Each step can have a link to platform features or external sites
- Progress saved so users can return later
- Validation ensures users complete each step
