I want you to move the feedback on top of the chat. Keep the same chat button position on desktop. Slightly modified the design of the feedback bubble to look like a chat bubble from the chat icon.

You have changed the design of the feedback which is not what I wanted. What I wanted is you to add like a tail to the large bubble from feedback. So keep the previous design with the feedback text and icon. Just add the tail that points towards the button underneath it. It will look like it goes out of the chat button like a message.
